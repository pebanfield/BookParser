GERMII^AL. 



• CHAPTER I. 

Ok an open plain, under a starless sky black and 
thick as ink, a solitary man was following the main 
road from Marchiennes to Montson, a paved way of ten 
kilometres, cutting straight through fields of beets. He 
could not even see the dark ground before him, and he 
was insensible to the immense plain around him, except 
from blasts of March wind, great gusts as on the sea, 
biting cold, sweeping over leagues of marsh and naked 
field. No shade of tree specked the sky ; the road un- 
folded itself with the regularity of a jetty amid the 
darkening shadows of the night. 

The man had started from Marchiennes at two o^clock. 
He had walked with great strides, shivering beneath the 
thin lining of his velvet vest and pantaloons. A small 
bundle, tied up in a checked handkerchief, annoyed 
him greatly, and he rested it against his hips, sometimes 
on one side and sometimes on the other, to enable him 
to put both hands into the depths of his pockets at the 
same time, hands benumbed and deprived of blood by 
the cutting east wind. A single thought occupied his 
mind — a mechanic without work and without home — ' 
the hope that the cold would be less severe after the 
break of day. For an hour and a half he had pro- 
ceeded in this manner, when, two kilometres from 
Montson, he perceived, on the left, some red fires, three 
brasiers of glowing coal burning as if suspended in the 
open air. At first, through fear, he hesitated, then he 
could not resist the pitiful desire to warm his hands an 
instant. 

A steep path ran down before him. Then all was 
dark. On his right was a high board fence shutting in 
a railroad, while on the left rose a weedy slope sur-

mounted by a confusion of gables, the outlines of a 
village of low and irregular roofs. He took about two 
hundred steps. Suddenly the fires again came into 
view close to him, at one side of the path, without his 
comprehending how they burned so high in the black 
sky like luminous moons. But close to the ground 
another spectacle made him pause. It was a heavy 
mass, a cluster of low buildings, from which rose the 
outlines of the chimney of a mauufactory ; strange 
lights came from the dirty windows, outside five or six 
dull lanterns were hanging from a frame structure, the 
blackened timbers of which vaguely defined the outlines 
of a huge trestle-work, and from that phantom-like ap- 
parition, shrouded in smoke and darkness, a single 
sound was heard, the long, loud respiration of escaping 
steam, which was not visible. 

Then the young man saw it was a mine. He again 
became disheartened. What good ? He would get no 
work there. Instead of directing his steps toward the 
building, he finally ventured to climb the hill on which 
burned the three coal fires, in iron kettles, to give light 
and heat. The outside workmen had been obliged to 
work late ; they were still clearing away the useless rub- 
bish. Now he could hear the pushers shoving their cars 
upon the trestles, and he distinguished flitting shadows 
tipping them up near each fire. 

*' Good-evening," said he, approaching one of the 
kettles. 

The driver was standing with his back to the fire, a 
little old man, dressed in a purple wool jacket, on his 
head was an old rabbit-skin cap; while his horse, a 
large fawn-colored beast, waited motionless as stone, 
while they emptied the six cars which he had drawn up. 
This work was done by an assistant, a jolly fellow, red 
and healthy, who hurried little, pressing upon the lever 
with a heavy hand. Up there the wind was still more 
severe, a freezing wind, whose great regular blasts swept 
on like the blows of a scythe. 

" Good-evening," replied the old man. 

Silence followed. The man who felt himself regarded 
with suspicion immediately made known his name. 

"I call myself Etienne Lantier, I am a machinist. 
Is there not some work for me here?" 



GERMINAL. 9 

The flames threw a light upon him, he was about 
twenty-one years old, very dark, a handsome fellow, 
apparantly strong notwithstanding his slight limbs. 

Eeassured, the driver shook his head. 

^'Work for a machinist? No, no. . . . There 
were two here yesterday. There was nothing for 
them." 

A gust of wind cut off his words. Then, Etienne 
demanded, pointing to the dark spot where the build- 
ings stood at the foot of the hill, "That is a mine, is 
it not!" 

This time the old man could not respond. A violent 
fit of coughing choked him. Finally he spat, and his 
spittle left a dark spot upon the ground. 

"Yes, a mine, the Voreux. The entrance is close 

by-" 

Then, with out-stretched arm, he pointed out in the 
darkness, the village, the confused roofs of which the 
young man had already discerned. But the six cars 
were empty; with limbs stiff from rheumatism, he fol- 
lowed them without a crack of the whip, as the great 
fawn-colored horse had started off again, unbidden, 
plodding along between the rails, under a fresh squall 
of wind which ruffled up his coat. 

The Voreux was now becoming dear to him. Etienne, 
who had forgotten to warm his blood-chilled hands at 
the fire, was intently studying and making out each part 
of the mine; the tarred shed for screening, the tower 
of the shafts, the large room for the hoisting engine and 
the square turret of the machine for draining. This 
mine, down in a hollow, with its low brick buildings, 
lifting its chimney like a threatening horn, to him had 
the horrid semblance of a ravenous beast, crouching 
there ready to devour the world. While he was look- 
ing, he thought over his life of the last eight days, a 
tramp seeking a place; again he saw himself in the rail- 
way shops, slapping the face of his chief, driven from 
Lille, driven from everywhere; Saturday he had arrived 
in Marchiennes, where they told him he could get work 
at Forges; but there was nothing, either at Forges or at 
Sonneville, he had spent Sunday concealed in a ship- 
yard from which the superintendent ejected him at two 
o^clock in the morning. Nothing, not a sou, not even 



10 GERMINAL. 

a crust, had he obtained on the road; without aim, not 
even knowing where to shelter himself from the storms. 
Yes, it was undoubtedly a mine, the strange lanterns 
lit up the entrance to the shaft, a door opening sudden- 
ly enabled him to catch a glimpse of the furnaces of 
the boilers in a bright light. He now understood the 
escapement of steam, that great long respiration, puff- 
ing without stop, as if the breath of the monster was 
choked. 

The assistant, rounding his back, had not even lifted 
his eyes to Etienne, and the latter was about to take up 
his little bundle, which had fallen on the ground, when 
a fit of coughing announced- the return of the driver. 
They saw him coming slowly out of the darkness, fol- 
lowed by the fawn-colored horse, who- was bringing up 
six new-filled cars. 

*' Are there any works in Montson ?" asked the youth. 

The old man spit black, then answered in the wind : 

*'0h, it's not works that are wanted ; that ought to 
have been seen three or four years ago. Everything was 
prosperous, it was impossible to find workmen, they had 
never earned so much. . . . And then they began 
to feel the pangs of hunger. Sad fact for the country; 
they discharged the people, the shops shut up one after 
the other, . . . It is not the fault of the Emperor, 
perhaps, but why does he go to fight in America with- 
out considering that the brutes die of cholera as well as 
others?" 

Then, in short sentences, with breath interrupted, 
both continued to complain. Etienne related his use- 
less journey of a week. Must he perish from hunger ? 
Soon the roads would be full of beggars. 

"Yes," said the old man; "that will be a bad ending, 
for it is not in accordance with God's purpose to throw 
all Christians into the streets." 

"We don't have meat every day." 

"Still, if one has bread!" 

"True, if we only have bread!" 

Their voices were lost; gusts of wind carried away 
the words with a plaintive moan. 

"There's Montson," resumed the driver in a loud 
voice, turning toward the south. 

And again extending his hand, lie pointed toward 



GERMINAL. Il 

some objects invisible in the darkness, naming them in 
order. Down there in Montson the sugar-works of 
Fauvelle are still going, but the works of Hoton are 
shut down; there is nothing but the boiler-works of 
Dutilleuil and the rope manufactory of mine cables 
belonging to Bienze which are still running. Then, 
with a sweeping gesture extending over half the hori- 
zon, he pointed to the north, the machine shops of 
Sonneville had not received two-thirds of their usual 
orders; of the three blast furnaces of Forges and of 
Marchiennes, only two were lit, and even at the glass 
works of Gagebois a strike was threatened, for they 
talked of a reduction of salary. 

"I know, I know," repeated the young man at each 
indication, "I understand." 

"We others have gone on up to the present," added 
the driver. " The mines, however, have decreased their 
work, look before you at the Victoria, they have only 
two tiers of coke ovens which are going." 

He spat and started out again behind his sleepy horse, 
after having hitched him to the empty cars. 

Now Etienne understood the whole country. The 
shades of night were still deep, but the old man had so 
filled them with great forebodings, that the youth uncon- 
sciously felt himself, particularly at that hour, within 
the limitless unknown. Was not that a cry of hunger 
which followed the March wind through that naked 
country! The winds were enraged, they seemed to bear 
the death of work, and a famine which should destroy 
many people. And with his wandering eyes he endeav- 
ored to pierce the darkness, distressed by the desire and 
yet the fear of sight. Everything is annihilated in the 
unknown obscurity of night; he could only perceive, in 
the distance, the blast furnaces and the coke fires. 
These with rows of a hundred chimneys, set obliquely, 
traced by the ascent of ruddy flames; while two towers 
more to the left burned up all blue in the open air like 
giant torches. It had the sadness of incendiarism, no 
lights of stars shone forth from the threatening sky, 
only these nocturnal fires belonging to a country of 
coal and iron. 

" You are perhaps from Belgium," resumed the driver, 
having returned behind Etienne. 



12 GERMINAL. 

This time he had only brought three cars. They 
could easily be emptied; an accident had happened at 
the hoisting cage, a screw-nut broke, stoppiDg the work 
for a quarter of an hour. At the foot of the hill, a 
silence had fallen, the moulineurs were no longer shaking 
the trestles with their constant pushing. One only 
heard coming from the mine the distant sound of a 
hammer striking upon iron. 

*'No, I am from the south," responded the young 
man. 

The assistant, after having emptied the carts, seated 
himself upon the ground, glad of the accident, main- 
taining his mute unsociability. He had simply raised 
his large dull eyes to the driver as if annoyed by all his 
talk. The latter, in fact, spoke very little usually. It 
was necessary that the face of a stranger pleased him, 
and that he should be found in one of those longings 
for confidence which sometimes make old people talk 
aloud even to themselves. 

''As for me," said 'he, ''Vn\ from Montson ; I'm 
called Bonnemort." 

"Is that a surname?" asked Etienne, astonished. 

The old man laughed in a disagreeable manner and 
pointed to the Voreux. 

• "Yes, yes; they have taken me three times from 
inside — once with all my skin scorched, another time 
with the earth up to my throat, the third with my 
stomach filled with water like a frog. . . . Then 
when they saw that I couldn't be killed, they called me 
'Bonnemort,' for fun." 

His gaiety redoubled, and his disagreeable laugh 
brought on a terrible fit of coughing. The fire kettle 
now fully lit up his great head with its strange looking 
white hair, and his unanimated face of a livid hue, cov- 
ered with bluish spots. He was short, with an enormous 
neck, the calves of his legs and his heels bare, with long 
arms and hands which reached down to his knees; as for 
the rest, like his horse which remained motionless upon 
its feet without appearing to feel the wind, he seemed of 
stone, he acted as though he had no suspicion of the 
cold or the gusts of wind whistling in his ears. When 
he coughed, his throat was racked in a terrible manner; 



GERMINAL. 13 

he spat at the foot of the kettle, and the ground was 
blackened. 

Etienne looked at him, and then at the ground which 
he stained in that manner. 

*' Have you worked in the mine a long time?" said he. 

Bonnemort threw up both arms. 

*'A long time, ah! yes! I wasn't eight years old 
when I went right down into the Voreux, and I'm forty- 
eight now. Reckon a little I've been everything in there, 
' galihut' first, then ' herchem,' as I had the strength to 
succeed in each kind of work in rotation, then ' haveur ' 
for eighteen years. Finally, on account of my cursed 
limbs, they put me above ground, as outside workman, 
until they wanted me to go to the bottom, for the doctor 
said I'd go there to stay. Then, after I had five years 
of that, they made me a driver. Well, its all right, 
forty years of a mine with thirty-five spent at the bot- 
tom." 

While he was speaking some pieces of burning coal, 
which meanwhile had fallen from the kettle, illumined 
his sallow face with a reddening reflection. 

"They told me to rest," continued he. ''Me — I 
couldn't do that. If they think me so foolish, I'll keep 
on two years longer until my sixtieth year, to get the 
pension of a hundred and sixty sous. If I should wish 
them good-day to-day, they would immediately give me 
a hundred and fifty. They're sly, the rogues ! . . . 
Moreover, I'm sound apart from my legs. You see, it's 
the water which has entered beneath the skin, on ac- 
count of being soaked m the mine. Some days I can't 
move a foot without crying." 

A coughing spell again interrupted him. 

"And that is what makes you cough so?" said 
Etienne. 

But he shook his head violently. Then, when he 
could speak : 

"No, no, I caught cold some months ago. I never 
used to cough, but now I can't get rid of it. . . . 
The strange thing is that I spit — it's strange. . . ." 

His throat again filled up and he spat black. 

"Do you spit blood?" demanded Etienne, at last 
daring to question him. 



14 GERMINAL. 

Slowly Bonnemort wiped off his mouth with the back 
of his hand. 

''It's coal. . . . I have enough in my carcass to 
warm me the rest of my days. And I've not put my 
foot down below for five years. I had that on hand, 
sure. Bah ! it keeps." 

There was silence, the neighboring hammer beat its 
regular blows in the mine, the wind passed on with its 
wail like the cry of hunger and weariness coming from 
the depths of the night. Before the flames which 
looked wild, the old man continued in a lower voice, 
turning over in his mind the days gone by. Ah! cer- 
tainly, it was not yesterday that he and his struck the 
vein! His family had worked for the company of the 
Montson mines since the start; and that dated far back, 
it had been then already a hundred and six years. His 
grand-father, Guillaume Maheu, a boy of thirteen 
years then, had found the rich coal at Eequillart, the 
first mine of the company, an old abandoned mine 
to-day, down near the sugar-mill of Fauvelle. All the 
country knew him, to prove which the vein discovered 
was called the vein Guillaume, the first name of his 
grand-father. He had not known him, a large man 
they say, very strong, who died of old age at sixty 
years. Then his father, Nicolas Maheu, called le Rouge, 
when less than forty years of age, was burned in the 
Voreux, that they were sinking at that time: a cave-in 
completely crushed him, the rocks drank his blood and 
swallowed up his bones. Two of his uncles and his 
three brothers, later on, had also lost their lives there. 
He, Vincent Maheu, who of them all was left a little 
better preserved, except the crooked legs, passed for a 
rogue. What matter, however! he worked. They said 
that of the father and his sons, like they would have 
said anything else. His sons, All-saints-day Maheu had 
died, and his little sons, and all his people who were 
working in front of him, in the same gallery. One 
hundred and five years of digging down, the children 
after the old men, for the same master: well; many of 
the bosses could not have told so good a story. 

" Still, when one canjeat!" murmured Etienne again. 

''That's what I say: while one has bread to eat one 
can live." 



GERMINAL. 15 

Bonnemort became silent, his eyes turned toward the 
alley, where some lights shone out one by one. Four 
o^clock sounded by the clock of Monston, the cold be- 
came greater. 

"And is your company rich?" asked Etienne. 

The old man lifted his shoulders, then let them drop, 
as though overwhelmed by the thought of money. 

" Ah! yes; ah! yes. . . . Not as rich, perhaps as its 
neighbor the company of Anzin. But millions and 
millions all the same. They can't count them any 
longer. . . . Nineteen mines, of which thirteen 
ar^ worked, the Voreux, Victoire, Crèvecœur, Miron, 
Saint-Thomas, Madeleine, Feutry-Cantel and still 
others, and six which are worn out, with air shafts like 
Eéquillart. . . . Ten thousand workmen, grants 
which extend over sixty-seven communes, an output of 
five thousand tons per day, a railroad uniting all the 
mines, and some shops and buildings. . . . Ah! 
yes; ah! yes, they have money!" 

A rolling of cars upon the way, made the great fawn- 
colored horse prick up his ears. The cage had been re- 
paired below, and the inouUneiirs had resumed their 
work. While he harnessed the beast to redescend, the 
driver added softly, speaking to himself: 

*'You mustn't let yourself talk so much, deuced idle- 
ness ! ... If M. Hennebeau knew how much time 
had been spent." 

Etienne, deep in thought, was looking out into the 
night. He inquired : 

"Then the mine belongs to M. Hennebeau ?" 

"No," explained the old man, "M. Hennebeau is 
only the overseer. He is payed like us." 

With a gesture the young man stared into the bound- 
less depths of the night. 

"Whose is it, then?" 

But Bonnemort remained an instant suffocated by a 
new fit of coughing of such violence that he could not 
get his breath. At last, when he had spat and wiped 
the black matter from his lips, he said, in the wind 
which was increasing : 

"What — to whom does it belong ? We don't know. 
To somebody." And with his hand he pointed into the 
darkness vaguely to an unknown and remote place, in- 



16 GEilMiKAL, 

habited by those people for whom the Maheus had dug 
the vein for more than a century. His voice had taken 
a sort of religious fear ; it was as if he had spoken of an 
inaccessible tabernacle, wliere was hidden the unknown 
God who gave them their portion without their knowing 
him. 

"But if, at least, one had bread in sufficiency!" re- 
peated Etienne for the third time without apparent 
change. 

"Yes, indeed! if one always had bread, that would 
be good." 

The horse had started, the driver disappeared in his 
turn, with the loitering step of an invalid. The 
assistant had not budged; drawn up in a ball, with his 
chin thrust between his knees, his great dull eyes were 
fixed upon vacancy. 

When he had taken up his bundle Etienne still 
loitered. He felt the wind freezing his back, while in 
front he was burning before the huge fire. Perhaps, all 
the same, it would be wise for him to inquire at the 
works; the old man could not know; then he became 
resigned, he would accept any work. Where could he 
go, and what would become of him' in that country 
famishing from the stoppage of work; must he lay his 
carcass behind a wall like a lost dog? But he hesitated 
through fear of the Voreux, in the midst of that level 
plain shrouded by a night so thick. At every blast the 
wind seemed stronger, as if it blew from a constantly 
enlarging horizon. Not one peep of day whitened that 
dead sky, the high chimneys alone flamed out, and the 
coke fires reddened the darkness without revealing the 
unknown. And the Voreux at the bottom of the hol- 
low, with its settlement of wretched creatures, was still 
more darkly hidden, breathing a deeper and longer 
breath, troubled with its painful digestion of human 
flesh. 



CHAPTEE II. 



Among fields of wheat and beets, the alley of the 
Duexcent-Quarante slept under the dark night. One 
could vaguely distinguish from long rows of little houses 



GERMINAL. 17 

back to back, regularly laid out, parallel, as in barracks, 
or a hospital, which three wide streets separated, divid- 
ing into equal plats. On the bleak plain, there was only 
heard the wail of the wind tearing away the trelliage of 
the inclosure. 

At Maheu's house, number 16 on the last row, no one 
was moving. The darkest gloom filled the single room 
on the first floor, as though to overwhelm with its 
weight the sleep of the human beings resting there, 
sleeping with open mouths, overcome with fatigue. In 
spite of the terrible cold outside, the heavy air was quite 
warm, that stifling heat of badly ventilated rooms, 
tainted by the occupants. 

Four was struck by the wooden clock on the first floor, 
no one moved as yet, heavy breathing was constantly 
heard, accompanied by two loud snores. And suddenly 
Catherine awoke. In her weariness she had counted as 
usual the four strokes of the bell, through the ceiling, 
without the strength to completely awake herself. Then 
throwing her limbs out of the bed, she groped around; 
at length striking a match, she lit the candle. But she 
remained seated on the edge of the mattress, her head 
so heavy that it fell backward, yielding to an invincible 
wish to again drop upon the pillow. 

Now the candles lit up the room, square, having two 
windows and filled with three beds. There was a bu- 
reau, a table, two walnut chairs, while a smoky appear- 
ance hung heavily on the walls of the room, painted a 
light yellow. This was all ; some rags hung on nails, a 
jug was placed on the table beside a red pan, used as a 
wash-basin. In the bed on the left, Zacharie, the eld- 
est, a boy of twenty-one years, was lying with his bro- 
ther Jeanlin, who had just completed his eleventh year; 
in the bed on the right two little children, Lenore and 
Henri, the first six and the other four years of age, were 
sleeping in each other's arms, while Catherine shared 
the third bed with her sister, so small, although nine 
years of age, that she could scarcely have felt her by her 
side had it not been for the hump on the little invalid 
which crowded her ribs inward. The glazed door was 
open, and you could see the stairway and a small room 
where the mother and father occupied a fourth bed, by 
2 



18 GERMINAL. 

the side of which they were obliged to place the cradle 
of the last comer, Estelle, scarce three months old. 

jMeanwhile Catherine made a desperate effort. She 
ran both hands through the red hair which covered her 
forehead and neck. Thin for her sixteen years, her 
limbs were not exposed below the straight skirt of her 
chemise; only her feet appeared, bluish as if tattoed 
with coal, and her thin arms, white as milk, which con- 
trasted with the sallow tint of her face, already spoiled 
by continual washing with soft soap. One last yawn 
opened her rather large mouth, filled with superb teeth 
in pale sickly gums ; while her watery grey eyes, striv- 
ing against sleep with an expression sad and weary, 
seemed to be filled with the fatigue of her entire person. 

A growl arose from the landing, the voice of Maheu 
stammering out: 

" Good heavens! it is time to get up. . . . Have 
you a light, Catherine?" 

"Yes, father. . . . The clock has just struck, 
down stairs." 

"Make haste then, drone. If you had danced less 
yesterday, you would have awakened us sooner. . . . 
There*s an idle life for you." 

And he continued to growl, but sleep at last over- 
came him, and his reproaches, which were taken no 
notice of, died away in another snore. 

The young girl, still in her chemise, moved about the 
room in her bare feet; pausing before the bed of Henri 
and Lenore, she laid over them the covers which they 
had thrown off; they did not awake, lost in the sound 
sleep of infancy. Alzire, her eyes open, turned over 
and took the warm place of her large sister, without 
saying a word. 

"Get up, Zacharie! and you, too, Jeanlin, get up!" 
said Catherine standing before the tv/o brothers who 
remained silent, their noses in the pillow. 

She seized the largest boy by the shoulder and shook 
him, then when he became abusive she snatched the 
coverings off him. That amused her, for she laughed 
loudly, when she saw the two boys struggling, with 
bare legs. 

"That's silly; leave me alone!" stammered Zacharie, 



GERMINAL. 19 

in a bad humor, when he sat up. "I don't like that 
fun, it's enough to say it's time to get up." 

He was thin, ill-formed, his face long, covered with 
an odd-looking beard, with the yellow hair and sallow 
complexion of all the family. When his shirt was 
thrown up he pulled it down, not from shame, but be- 
cause it was cold. 

" The clock has struck," said Catherine. " Get up, 
lazy! your father will be angry." 

jeanlin, who was circled up in a heap, opened his 
eyes and said: "Go 'way and stop 3'our fooling; I'm 
sleepy." 

She laughed again. He was so little with his puny 
legs and large joints, swollen with scrofula, that she 
took him in her arms. He kicked about, his wan, 
monkey-like face and curly head, with his sharp eyes 
and large ears, turning pale Avith rage, because he was 
feeble. He said nothing, he knew in his heart she was 
doing right. 

"Bad child!" murmured she, repressing a sob and 
placing him on the floor. 

Alzire, silent, the sheet drawn wç to her chin, was 
not asleep. She followed, wnth the intelligent eyes of 
an invalid, her sister aud two brothers, who were now 
dressing themselves. Another quarrel broke out around 
the wash-basin, the boys hustled the young girl out of 
the way, because it took her too long to wash. Their 
night clothes flew off, while, still filled with sleep, they 
dressed themselves with the tranquil freedom of a litter 
of young dogs growing up together. Catherine was 
ready first. She jumped into her miner's trousers, 
slipped on the linen vest, knotted the blue scarf around 
her head, and in this w^eekday garb she had the appear- 
ance of a little man; nothing remained of her sex ex- 
cept the slightly waddling gait. 

"When the old man comes back," said Zacharie 
spitefully, " he'll be glad to find the bed tossed up. 
. . . I'll tell him 'twas you, you know." 

He spoke of the grandfather, old Bonncmort, who 
w^orked at night and slept during the day. The bed 
never was cold, it always had some one snoring within it. 

Without replying, Catherine was jjulling up tlie cov- 
erings and tucking them in. But. at that instant a 



^0 GERMINAL. 

noise wtis lieard the other side of the wall, in the neigh- 
boring house. These brick buildings, economically 
constructed by the company, were so frail that the 
least breath traversed them. They lived elbow to elbow 
as it were, from one end of the row to the other, and 
nothing of private life remained concealed, even to the 
children. A heavy step shook the stairs, then there 
was a sound something like a light fall, followed by a 
sigh of relief. 

''Good! . . ." said Catherine, " Levaque has 
gone down stairs, and here is Bouteloup, who is coming 
up again to see Levaque's wife." 

Jeanlin sneered, the eyes of Alzire shone. Every 
morning they amused themselves thus, with the inti- 
macy of these three neighbors, a liaveur who lodged 
an outside workman which gave the woman two men, one 
for the night and the other for the day. 

"Philoniene is coughing,'' resumed Catherine, after 
listening. 

She was speaking of the Levaque's eldest, a large girl 
of nineteen years, the mistress of Zacharie, to whom 
she had already borne two children, with such weak 
lungs though that she was a sifter, and never had 
worked inside the mine. 

"Ah, yes. Philomene," replied Zacharie. "She 
don't mind that, she's asleep. She's a pig to sleep until 
six o'clock." 

He was putting on his pants when he opened a win- 
dow as if a thought had suddenly struck him. Out- 
side, in the dark, the alleyway was lit up, lights shone 
out one after another between the cracks of the window 
blinds. And that was the occasion of another dispute 
with his sister. He leaned out trying to see if the 
superintendent, whom they accused of visiting Pierron's 
wife, was at her house across the way, when his sister 
told him that since the day before the husband had 
been doing day work at the breaker, and that Dansaert 
could not possibly have slept there that night. The 
air entered in chilling puffs, both were becoming angry 
maintaining the correctness of their knowledge, when 
cries broke out. They were from the cradle. The cold 
was disturbing Estelle. 

Suddenly Maheu awoke, they heard him growling 



GERMINAL. 21 

angrily. What was the matter with him? he had slept 
like a beggar! And he swore so loud that the child 
beside him held its breath. Zacharie and Jeanlin slowly 
finished washing themselves, they were weary even now. 
Alzire, her great eyes open, watched them constantly. 
Tlie two little ones, Lenore and Henri, with their arms 
around each other, had not moved, breathing regularly, 
in si)ite of the tumult. 

"Catherine, give me the candle!" cried Maheu. 

She finished byttoning her vest and carried the candle 
into the chamber, leaving her brothers to find their 
clothing from the little light which came through the 
door. Her father jumped out of bed. But she did not 
stop, she went down stairs in her coarse woolen stock- 
ings, and feeling her way she lit another candle in the 
kitchen to prepare the coffee. All the shoes of the 
family were under the cupboard. 

" Shut up,'' said Maheu, exasperated by Estelle's con- 
tinued crying. 

He was short like old Bonnemort, and resembled him 
in stoutness; his head was large, his face of a livid hue, 
with close-cut yellow hair. The infant yelled louder, 
frightened by the great bare arms which were held 
above her. 

"Let her alone; you know very well that she will not 
be quiet," said the mother, stretching herself out in the 
middle of the bed. 

She also, having just awakened, began to complain. 
It was too bad never to get a good night's rest. Couldn't 
they leave quietly? Buried in the covering, she only 
showed her long figure and traces of a lifeless kind of 
beauty, already destroyed at the age of thirty-nine years 
by her life of misery and the seven children which she 
had borne. With her eyes on the ceiling, she began to 
speak slowly, while her husband dressed himself. The 
infant was still crying, neither paying any attention 
to it. 

"Well, I've told you I haven't a sou left, and this is 
Monday — still six days to wait for the fifteenth. This 
can't go on any longer. All of you only earn nine 
francs a day, and how do you expect me to get along? 
We have ten in the family." 

"Oh! nine francs," growled Maheu. "Zacharie and 



23 GERMINAL. 

I three, that makes six. . . . Catharine and the 
father two, that makes four; four and six, ten. . . . 
and Jeanlin one, that makes eleven." 

"Yes, eleven; but there are the Sundays and the 
days you knock off. Never more than nine, do you see." 

He did not reply at once, being engaged in looking 
on the floor for his leather belt. Then he said, raising 
himself up : 

"You shouldn't grumble. I'm healthy, anyhow. 
There are very few at the age of forty-two who haven't 
been through some sickness." 

"True, old man, but that doesn't give us bread. 
What am I going to do ? You have nothing." 

"I have two sous." 

" Keep them for a drink. . . " . My God ! what 
am I going to do ; six days, they will never end. We 
owe sixty francs to Maigrat, who turned me from his 
door the day before yesterday. He refused to give us a 
loaf of bread. That will not prevent me from going to 
him again to-day. But if he keeps on refusing . . ." 

And the woman continued in a plaintive tone, her 
head motionless, closing her eyes for an instant to shut 
out the light of the candle. She said the cupboard was 
empty, the children wanted bread, even coffee was 
needed, for water gave them the colic ; the long days 
must pass in trying to satisfy their hunger with boiled 
cabbage leaves. Little by little she had been obliged to 
raise her voice, for the screams of Estelle drowned her 
words. These cries became unbearable. Maheu seemed 
all at once to become conscious of them. Almost crazy, 
he seized the little one from the cradle and threw her 
upon tlie bed of the mother, stammering with rage : 

"Take her, or I'll choke her. Great heavens, that 
child ! She don't want anything, and yet she makes 
more fuss than anyone else." 

Estelle had at last began to nurse. Disappearing 
under the covers, quieted by the warmth of the bed, she 
made no sound but a little smack of the lips. 

" Didn't the rich folks of the Piolame tell you to go 
and see them?" resumed the father, at the end of a 
silence. 

The mother puckered up her mouth with an air of 
contempt. 



GERMINAL. 23 

''Yes, they met me; they'll give some clothing to the 
poor children. ... At any rate I'll take Lenore 
and Henri to them this morning. If they would only 
give me a hundred sous! "" 

Silence was renewed. Maheu was ready. He stood 
still a moment, then he concluded with his harsh voice: 

"What do you want; it is always so; get some soup. 
. . . This won't keep us from starving, it is better to 
be below at work.'^ 

''That's so/' responded the wife. "Blow out the candle, 
I don't want to see the color of my thoughts.'* 

He blew out the candle. Zacharie and Jeanlin had 
already gone down; he followed them, and the wooden 
staircase creaked under their heavy feet clothed in wool. 
Behind them, in the passage and chamber, it was dark 
again. The little ones were sleeping, even Alzire's eye- 
lids were closed. But the mother now remained with 
her eyes open in the darkness, while pulling upon her 
weary breast, Estelle purred like a little kitten. 

Down stairs, Catherine was at first busy at the stove 
which had an iron flue, an oven on each side and a grate 
in the centre, in which a coal fire was constantly burn- 
ing. The company gave monthly to each family eight 
bushels of screenings, hard coal picked up on the 
tracks. It lit with difficulty, and the 3'oung girl who 
covered the fire every night was obliged to rake it in 
the morning and add some little pieces of soft coal, 
sorted out with care. Then she placed a kettle full of 
water upon the grate and knelt down before the cup- 
board. 

It was a large enough room, taking up the whole 
ground floor, painted apple green, of a Flemish neat- 
ness, with its flagstones well washed and sprinkled with 
white sand. Beside the cupboard of varnished pine, 
the furniture consisted of a table and some chairs of 
the same wood. Hanging on the wall, gaudily colored, 
were the portraits of the Emperor and Empress given 
by the company, some soldiers and saints, a mixture of 
gilt, harmonizing strangely with the jilain nakedness of 
the room, and for other ornaments, there was only a 
box of red paste-board upon the cupboard and a wooden 
clock with a glass front, whose loud tic-tac seemed to 
fill the emptiness of the place. Near the door of the 



24 GERMINAL. 

stairs, another door led to the cellar. In spite of the 
great cleanliness, an odor of cooked onions, shut in 
since the day before, poisoned the warm air which was 
already heavily charged with coal gas. 

Meanwhile, before the open cupboard, Catherine was 
reflecting. There was left, only one loaf of bread, with 
cheese in sufficiency, but scarcely a particle of butter, 
and it was a question, how to make sandwiches for all 
four. At last she decided, cutting the slices as thin as 
possible and covering one with cheese and another with 
butter she laid them together, and the lunch which was 
carried each morning to the mine was ready. Soon the 
four portions were in a row on the table, dealt out with 
a severe justice, from the great one for the father to 
the little one for Jeanlin. 

But the water had commenced to sing in the kettle. 
Catherine, who appeared to be a good housekeeper, 
could not, however, help musing over the things which 
Zacharie had told her, about the superintendent and 
the wife of Pierron, for she opened the street door and 
glanced outside with an instinctive movement, in spite 
of the certainty that where she stood there was nothing 
out of the way to be seen, that morning. The wind 
was still blowing, numerous lights fell upon the long 
projective fronts of the alley, from which went up the 
low hum of awakening. Doors were already opening, 
and dark files of workmen were moving off in the 
gloom. She was foolish to freeze herself there when 
the feeder at the breaker was still sleeping, before 
going to work at six o'clock! Yet she remained there 
watching the house before her, in the flat across the 
way. The door opened, her curiosity was excited. 
But it was only Pierron's little Lydie, who was starting 
for the mine. 

The hissing sound of steam made Catherine start. 
She shut the door and ran in, the water was boiling 
over, putting out the flre. There was no more coffee, 
she must be contented with pouring the water upon the 
old grounds; then she sweetened it with brown sugar. 
Just then her father and two brothers came down. 

"Plague take it!" said Zacharie, when he had put 
his lips to the cup, "this won't weaken our heads." 

Maheu shrugged his shoulders with a resigned air. 



GERMIXAL. 25 

''Bah! it's hot all the same, its good." 

Jeanlin picked up the bits of bread and butter and put 
them in his cup. Catharine after drinking, finished by 
draining the coffee pot into tin pails. All four remained 
standing, badly lit up by the smoking candle, drinking 
in haste. 

" Well, we're finished! " said the father, " One would 
tl^nk we were rich." 

Bat a voice came from the staircase, the door of which 
they had left open. It was the mother, who cried : 

"Take all the bread, I have a little vermicelli for the 
children." 

"Yes, yes!" responded Catherine. 

She had again covered the fire, leaving upon one corner 
of the grate the remaining cup of coffee, which the 
grandfather would find hot when he returned at six 
o'clock. Each took their pair of shoes from under the 
cupboard, placed the string of the tin pail over their 
shoulders, and stuffing the sandwich between the shirt 
and vest at their back, they went out, the men first, the 
girl behind, who blew out the candle and turned the 
key. The house again became dark. 

" Hold on! we'll all go together," said a man who had 
shut the door of tlie next house. 

It was Levaque, with his son Bebert, a boy of twelve 
years, a great friend of Jeanlin. 

Catherine, surprised, was laughing behind Zacharie; 
What? Bouteloup does not even wait for the husband 
to leave! 

Now, in the alley, the lights were going out. A last 
door shut, all slept again, the wives and the little ones 
returned to their naps in the middle of the less crowded 
beds. And from the silent village to the Voreux, under 
the heavy blasts, a slow file of shadows went on, it was 
the departure of the coal men for work, shrugging their 
shoulders, folding their arms across their breasts, while 
the sandwiches made a hump on each back. Clothed in 
light linen, they shivered with cold, without hurrying, 
marching along the road like an army. 



26 GEBMINAL. 



CHAPTER III. 

Etienne had ventured to approach the Voreux; and 
all the men to whom he addressed himself, asking if he 
could get work there, shook their heads and ended by 
telling liim to wait for tiie superintendent. They left 
him alone, in the midst of the badly lit buildings, filled 
with black holes confusing with the intricacy of their 
rooms and floors. He had just mounted a dark flight 
of steps, half decayed, when he found himself upon a 
swinging foot-bridge, then having passed through the 
screening shed, he 2)lunged into a darkness so profound 
that he walked with his hands before him, so as not to 
hurt himself. Suddenly, in front of him, two enor- 
mous yellow eyes hown out of the gloom. He was 
under the tower, at the superintendent's oflice at the 
mouth of the shaft. 

A miner, the elder Richomme, with a large soldier-like 
figure and gray mustache, was walking slowly, directing 
his steps toward the superintendent's office. 

"Do they need a workman here, no matter for what 
kind of work?" again inquired Etienne. 

Richomme started to say no; but he checked himself 
and responded, like the others, with a nod of the head: 

"Wait for Monsieur Danseart, the superintendent." 

Four lanterns were set there, and the reflections, 
which were all turned toward the mouth of the shafts 
shone brightly upon the iron inclined plane, the hand- 
spikes and the plane upon which the two cages were 
slid in. As for the rest, the large room, like tlie nave 
of a church, remained in a strange light, filled with 
great floating shadows. Only the oil light flamed out 
at the end of the place, while in the superintendent's 
room a small lamp gleamed like a dim star. The 
hoisting had just been resumed; and upon the iron 
flagging there was a continual din, the coal cars rolling 
by without ceasing, the running to and fro of the 
mouUjieurs, whose long, bent forms were distinguish- 
able in the midst of the confusion of all these black and 
noisy things, which were in constant motion. 



GERMINAL. 37 

For an instant Etienne remained motionless, deaf- 
ened, blinded. He was chilled with the currents of air 
coming in from outside. Then he stepped forward 
attracted by the engine, the shining steel and copper of 
which he now saw. It was located twenty-five metres 
in front of the shaft, in a higher room, and set so firmly 
upon its brick foundation that it ran at full steam, with 
all its four hundred horse power, with no movement but 
that of the crank, which rose and fell with a well-oiled 
smoothness, shaking the floor. The engineer stood at 
the throttle, listening for the sound of the signal, his 
eyes never leaving the indicator; on which the shaft was 
represented, with its different galleries by a vertical 
grove through which some plummets ran suspended by 
cords and representing the cages. And at each depart- 
ure, when the engine was again started, the drums, two 
great cylinder's five metres in circumference, about the 
centers of which steel cables wind and unwind in oppo- 
site directions, revolving with such rapidity that they 
look like nothing more than dust. 

"Take care!" cried two miners who were dragging a 
huge ladder. 

Etienne had just escajjed injury, his eyes becoming 
accustomed to the light, he Avatched the cable moving 
in the air, more than thirty metres of steel ribbon, 
which went up swiftly into the tower where they passed 
over the drums and then decended perpendicularly into 
the shaft to be connected to the hoisting cages. An 
iron framework similar to the high framework of the 
tower supported the drums. It was like the flight of 
birds, without noise, without collision, the movement 
swift, the continual coming and going of a cable of 
enormous weight, which would lift as much as twelve 
thousand kilogrammes at the rate of ten metres a 
second. 

"Great Heavens, look out!" again cried the men who 
were dragging the ladder to the other side to examine 
the drum on the left. 

Slowly Etienne returned to the superintendent's 
oflEice. That gigantic flight above his head astounded 
him. And, shivering in the drafts of air, he watched 
the working of the cages, his ears cracked by the rolling 
of the cars. . . . Near the shaft the signal was 



28 GERMINAL. 

operated — a heavy hammer upon a lever that a cord 
pulled from below let drop upon a block. One blow to 
stop, two to descend, three to come up. It was without 
intermission, like the blows of a gavel controlling a 
tumult, accompanied by the clear sound of a bell, 
wdiile the mouUneur directing the movement often in- 
creased the noise by shouting orders through a speaking 
trumpet to the engineer. The cages in the middle of 
the clear space appeared and sank down again, were 
emptied and re-filled without Etienne'^s nnderstanding 
anything of their complicated operations. He could 
only comprehend one thing: the shaft swallowed up the 
men in groups of twenty and thirty, and with a gulp so 
easy that he did not seem to notice them pass away. 
The descent of the workmen commenced at four o'clock. 
They arrived at the shed with bare feet, lamp in hand, 
waiting in little groups to make up the required num- 
ber. Noiselessly, with the stealthy spring of a night 
animal, the iron cage came up out of the darkness and 
was secured by bolts, with its four compartments con- 
taining each two cars filled with coal. Moidineiirs, 
at different landings, took out the cars and replaced 
them with others enijity, or filled in advance with cut 
timber. And it was the empty cars that the workmen 
filled, five by five, as many as forty at a time. When- 
ever the compartments were full a voice cried through 
the speaking trumpet (meanwhile a cord was pulled four 
times for a signal below) shouting A la viand, for the 
purpose of giving information that the load was human 
flesh; then, with a slight jerk, the cage silently disap- 
peared, dropping like a stone, leaving behind it only the 
trembling flight of the cable. 

"Is it deep?" asked Etienne of a miner who was 
waiting near him, with a sleepy air. 

'* Five hundred and forty-four metres," responded 
the man. "But there are four levels below, the first at 
three hundred and twenty." 

Both turned their eyes to the cable which was running 
up again. Etienne resumed: 

" And what if that should break?" 

"Ah! if it should!" 

The miner finished the sentence with a shrug. His 
turn had arri"ed, the cage had reappeared with its easy. 



GEEMIKAL. 29 

tireless movement. He crouched down there with 
some others, it i3lunged down again, reappearing at the 
end of four minutes, only to take on a new gang of 
men. For a half hour the shaft swallowed them up in 
this manner, Avith a mouth more or less greedy, accord- 
ing to the depth of the level to which they descended. 
But without a pause, always hungry, with the stomach 
of a giant capable of digesting a family. It filled itself 
repeatedly, and while the shadows still remained the 
cage rose out of the pit in the same eager silence. 

Etienne was again overtaken with the disheartened 
feeling which he had already experienced outside. 
Why trouble himself? that superintendent would dismiss 
him like the others. A vague fear suddenly determined 
him, he went away and stopped outside just before the 
boiler building. The door, wide open, showed seven 
boilers and two furnaces. In the midst of white steam 
and a hissing noise, a fireman was occupied in charging 
one of the furnaces, the scorching heat of which could 
be felt as far as the door sill; and the young man pleased 
with the thought of getting warm was approaching, 
when he nearly ran into another company of coal men 
who were arriving at the mine. It was Maheu and 
Levaque, when he perceived Catherine ahead with the 
air of a quiet boy, the wild idea seized him of risking a 
last inquiry. 

" Say, now, comrade, they have no need of a work- 
man here for anything, have they?" 

She looked at him in surprise, a little afraid of that 
sudden voice which came in out of the shadow. But, 
behind her, Maheu had heard, and he replied, stopping 
a little as he spoke. No they had no need of anyone. 
But that poor devil of a workman dying upon the road, 
interested him; when he left him he said to the others: 

"Well, we might be like that; we shouldn't com- 
plain, every one hasn't work to kill them." 

The company entered and went straight to the wait- 
ing room. A great hall, rudely plastered, surrounded 
with closets which were secured with padlocks. In the 
center a huge furnace, a kind of stove without cover, 
was glowing, so stuffed with burning coal that pieces 
were cracking and sizzing upon the floor of beaten 
earth. The hall was only lit up by that fire of live 



30 GERMINAL. 

coal, the reflections of which danced along the dirty 
wainscoting np to the ceiling which was covered with 
black dust. 

When the Maheus arrived, langhs broke forth in the 
great heat. Thirty of the workmen were standing, 
their backs to the flame, roasting themselves with an air 
of enjoyment. Before the descent they all came there 
to take and carry away in their skins a good bit of fire, 
to brave the dampness below. But that morning they 
were more cheerful, they joked with Morquette, a 
lierclieuse of nineteen years, a jolly girl, whose large 
breasts and hips swelled out her vest and breeches. 
She lived in Eequillart, with her father, old Moque, a 
groom, and her brother Moquet. a miner. The hours 
of work were the same for all, but she came alone to 
the mine, and among the wheat fields in summer or 
behind walls in winter she met her lovers of the week. 
She had had the whole mine, a fact mentioned by her 
companions without further notice. One day when a 
nailmaker of Marchiennes had taunted her, she nearly 
died of anger, crying that she respected herself so 
much; that she would cut off an arm if any one could 
say they had seen her with another than a miner. 

" Isn't it the big Cheval any more ?" said a miner, 
laughing. " And you're takin' that little fellow. He'll 
have to use a ladder, I've seen you behind Eequillart, 
and to prove it he was standing on a stone." " Well ?" 
responded Moquette, in a good humor, " what's that to 
you ? We didn't call you to help us." 

And these rude pleasantries increased the mirth of 
the men who were thi'owing forward their shoulders, 
scorched by the fire, while they shook with laughter. 
She walked among them, with an impudent air and 
tantalizing joke, with her projecting lumps of flesh 
exaggerated even to a deformity. 

Meanwhile the fun ceased. Moquette was telling 
Maheu that Fleurance, big Fleu ranee, could come no 
more; they had found him the day before dead upon 
his bed, some said of a disease of the heart, and others, 
of a pint of gin drunk too quickly. And Maheu was in 
despair from the mishap, that was a loss of one of his 
herchetises, without being able to immediately replace 
him. He did piecework; there were four haveurs 



GERMIIJAL. 31 

associated at his work, hé, Zacharie, Levaqne and 
Chaval. If they had only Catherine to push the cars, 
the work was going to suffer. Suddenly he had an idea: 

" Hold on ! there's that man who was looking for 
work." 

Just then Dansaert passed before the waiting room. 
Maheu related the trouble to him, asking leave to hire 
the man; and he irfsisted upon the wish of the Company 
to gradually replace the pushers by youths like at Anzin. 
The superintendent smiled at first, the idea of exclud- 
ing the women from inside was generally repugnant to 
the miners, who were not uneasy at placing their daugh- 
ters there, little touched by the question of morality 
or health. Finally, after having hesitated, he gave per- 
mission, but with the reservation that his decision 
should be ratified by M. Negrel, the engineer. 

" All right," declared Zacharie, "the man is not far 
off, if he has walked at all." 

"No," said Catherine, "I saw him stop at the boil- 
ers." 

" Go after him, idiot," cried Maheu. 

The young girl rushed out, while a crowd of miners 
started down the shaft, yielding the fire to the others. 
Jeanlin did not wait for his father, but also went, taking 
his lamp, with Thebut, a great stupid boy, and Lydie, 
a wild girl of twelve years. Starting before them. 
Moquette was screaming on the dark stairway, calling 
them dirty brats and threatening to box their ears if 
they pinched her. 

Etienne, in the boiler shed, was talking with the 
stoker who fed the fires. He shivered greatly at the 
thought of the cold night which he had passed. How- 
ever, he had decided to set out again when he felt a 
hand placed on his shoulder. 

" Come," said Catherine, "here's some work for you 
to do." 

At first he did not understr.nd. Then he experienced 
a feeling of joy, and vigorously pressed the hands of the 
young girl. 

"Thanks, comrade. . . . Ah! you are indeed a 
good fellow." 

She laughed, and looked at him in the red rays of 
the fire which lit them up. It amused her that he still 



'62 GEEMINAL. 

took bcr for a boy, lier li:&gt;ir tucked up under her cap. 
He also laughed with pleasure, and they both remained 
an instant, laughing in each others faces, their cheeks 
glowing. 

Maheu in the waiting room knelt down before his 
box, taking off his sabots and coarse woolen stockings. 
When Etienne arrived there they arranged all in a few 
words: thirty sous a day, it was hard work, but he would 
learn quickly. Maheu advised liim to keep on his shoes 
and lent him an old cap, a leather head-dress, designed 
to protect the head, a precaution which the father and 
children disdained. The tools were taken out of the 
chest where they found all ready the shovel of Fleurance. 
Then when Maheu had shut up their sabots and also 
Etienne's bundle, he suddenly became impatient, 

" What's the matter with that fool of a Chaval? We 
are a half hour late to-day." 

Zacbarie and Levaque shrugged their shoulders quiet- 
ly. The first said at length: 

"Is it Chaval we're waiting for? . . . He got here 
before us and went down at once." 

"What! you knew that and you said nothing. . . 
Com.e on! come on! hurry up!" 

Catherine, who was warming her benumbed hands, 
started to follow the party. Etienne let her pass, then 
followed. Again he found himself in a labyrinth of 
stairs and blind passages, where the bare feet made a 
soft noise like old socks. But suddenly, a small light 
blazed up, showing a glazed place filled with racks 
where a number of safety lamps were ranged in rows of 
a hundred, inspected and cleaned the evening before, 
shining out like tapers at the end of a lighted chapel. 
At tho door each workman took his own, placed at his 
number and examined it, closing it up himself, while 
the time-keeper seated at a table inscribed upon the 
register the hour of the descent. Maheu was obliged 
to ask for a lamp for his new pusher. And there was 
still another precaution taken, the men walked in single 
file before an inspecter who satisfied himself if all the 
lamps were well shut up. 

"The deuce! it's not warm here," murmured Cath- 
.erine, shivering. 

Etienne contented himself with nodding his head. 



6EKMINAL. 33 

He again had that shrinking feeling before the shaft, in 
the midst of that vast hall, filled with currents of air. 
True, he thought he was brave, but there came a disa- 
greeable sensation in his throat at the thundering of 
the cars, the heavy blows of the signal, the smothered 
bellowing of the speaking trumpet, in the sight of the 
continual flight of the cables which wound and unwound 
on their drums, wiîh the engine at full steam. The 
cages rose and fell with their stealthy movement of an 
animal of the night, always taking down some men 
which the mouth of the pit seemed to swallow. It was 
his turn now, he was very cold, he maintained a ner- 
vous silence which made Zacharie and Levaque laugh; 
both had disapproved of the hiring of that unknown, 
Levaque especially, who was offended by not having 
been consulted. But Catherine was pleased at seeing 
her father explain things to the young man. 

"See here, above the cage, here is a safety break, 
some iron clamps stick into the guides in case of a break. 
That works? Oh! not always. . . . Yes, the shaft is 
divided into three compartments, inclosed by planking 
from top to bottom. In the middle one are the cages, 
on the left one is a ladder. 

But he stopped to growl without raising his voice. 

"What's the matter? Good heavens! Is it right to 
freeze us in this manner?" 

The boss, Eichomme, who was likewise going down, 
his lamp fastened to a stud on his leather cap, heard the 
complaint. 

"Take care, the walls have ears! " kindly said the old 
miner, true to his companions, "the work must be done. 
. . . Hold on! We are there, get in with your 
people." 

The cage, composed of bars of iron and a fine wire 
mask, waited for them, held up by the locking bolts. 
Maheu, Zacharie, Levaque and Catherine crawled into 
a car at the bottom; and as it should hold five, Etienne 
entered also; but the good places were taken, and he 
was obliged to crouch down close to the young girl 
whose elbow stuck into his side. His lamp annoyed 
him, they advised him to fasten it to a button of his vest. 
He did not hear, and held it awkwardly in his hand. 
The loading continued above them, a mixed mass of 
3 



34 GERMINAL. 

humanity. It seemed to him so long that he lost all 
patience. At last a jerk shook them up and all became 
dark, the objects around him disappearing while he 
experienced a strange sensation of falling. The only 
light of day came from above the two stories of the 
office, struggling through the network of timbers, then 
falling into the blackness of the pit it disappeared until 
no longer preceptible to the senses. 

"Now we're off," said Maheu, quietly. 

They were all easy. But he each moment asked him- 
self if he was rising or falling. He was motionless 
while the cage went straight down without touching 
the guides, and with sudden bumps, finally producing 
a shaking of the joists which made him fear an acci- 
dent. Meanwhile, he could not distinguish the walls of 
the shaft beyond the grating against which he had put 
his face ; the lamps badly lit up the people at his feet. 
Only the open lamp of the boss in the neighboring car 
burned like a beacon. 

"This one is four metres in diameter,'' continued 
Maheu, instructing him. " The tubing ought to be 
rej)aired, for the v/ater filters on all sides. Hold on, 
we are arriving at a level, do you hear ? " 

Etienne suddenly asked himself what was that noise 
like a shower. Great drops finally sounded upon the 
top of the cage, at first like the beginning of a shower, 
and then the rain had increased, streaming down and 
changing into a veritable deluge. Yfithout doubt, the 
roofing was broken in, for a stream of water ran down 
the shoulders of the young man ; he trembled all over. 
The cold became intense, they were buried in a damp 
darkness. When they had rapidly gone down still lower 
they caught a glimpse of an ojieniug where men were 
bustling about in the rays of a lamp. But in an instant 
they were lost to sight. 

Maheu said : 

" That is the first gallery. We are three hundred 
and twenty metres down. . . . Look how fast we 
go." 

Raising his lamp, he lit up a joist of the guides, 
which ran like a rail under a train at full speed ; and 
beyond that they could see nothing. Three other gal- 



GERMINAL. 35 

leries were passed in the twinkling of an eye. The 
deafening rain fell in the darkness. 

•' llow dark it is I" murmured Etienne. 

The descent seemed to have lasted for hours. He 
was suffering from the uneasy position which he had 
taken, not daring to stir, especially on Catherine's side. 
She did not speak a-word; he only felt her against him, 
wa"ming him up. When the cage stopped at last, at 
the bottom, at five hundred and forty metres, he was 
astonished to learn that the descent had lasted just one 
minute. But the sound of the bolts which were slip- 
ping in place and the feeling of solidity under him, 
suddenly cheered him up and made him so happy that 
he spoke familiarly to Catherine. 

" What have you under your skin to be so warm? I 
have had your elbow in my side all the way." 

Then she also made merry. He was stupid to still 
take her for a boy. He must be blind. 

"I guess you've had it in your eyes — my elbow,I mean,'* 
responded she in the midst of a tempest of laughter 
which surprised the young man, who could not see the 
point. 

The cage was emptied, the workmen passed through 
the main opening of that gallery, a room in the rock, 
arched with masonry, and where three great open lamps 
were burning. The loaders were actively rolling some 
full cars upon the iron flooring. A cave-like odor fell 
from the walls, a smell of nitre with warm breaths of 
air came from a neighboring stable. Four drifts were 
worked there, yav&gt;^ning and dark. 

''Through here," said Maheu to Etienne. ''You're 
not there yet; we've two good kilometres to go." 

The workmen separated, disappearing in groups at 
the bottom of these dark holes. Fifteen men had just 
begun digging on the left, and Etienne walked beliiud 
Maheu who was preceded by Catherine, Zacharie and 
Levaque. It was a good wagon level cut out through a 
layer of coal and from a rock so solid that it had only 
needed to be partly walled. One after the other, they 
wind on and on by the little lights of the lamps. The 
young man hit against something at each step, catching 
his feet in the rails. Each instant a dull noise made 
him uneasy, the distant sound of a shower of rain, the 



36 GERMINAL. 

rush of which seemed to pi-ocee&lt;l from the bowels of the 
earth. Was that the thunder of the storm sending 
down upon their heads the enormous mass which sepa- 
rated them fiom the earth? A light pierced the night, 
he felt the rock tremble, and when he ranged himself 
along the wall like his comrades, he saw pass before his 
face a great white horse harnessed to a train of cai's, 
Herbert was seated on the first, holding the guides and 
driving, while Jeanlin, his hands pressed against the 
back pf the last car was running in his bare feet. 

They resumed their march. Farther on a crossway 
appeared, two new drifts opened, and the party agani 
divided, the men distributing themselves a few at a time 
in all parts of the mine. Now the wagon road was 
timbered, the wood, with its bark on, and of a palish 
yellow, supported the roof, making in the fallen rock 
an immense hole, sticking out of which one perceived 
sharp pieces of slate, sparkling with mica, and a heavy 
mass of stone, dull ai\d rough. Trains of cars, full or 
empty, were continually passing, crossing each other 
with their loads, carried in the darkness by a dumb 
beast, with a phantom-like trot. Across the two rails 
of the road a long black serpent was sleeping, a train 
stopped, the horse snorted, so startled in the night that 
his haunches dropped like a block trembling from an 
arch. The rough wooden doors slowly closed up, and 
the farther they advanced the straighter and lov/er the 
drifts became, while the uneven ceiling forced them to 
bend their backs constantly. 

Etienne severely bumped his head. Without the 
leather cap he would have cracked his skull. However, 
he followed with attention the least gestures of Maheu 
before him, whose dark shadow was produced by the 
rays of the lamp. Not one of the workmen knocked 
themselves; they were obliged to know each projection, 
every knot in the timber and enlargement of the rock. 
The young man was also distressed by the sli])ping 
ground which annoyed him more and more. Now and 
then he passed through some real pools which the mud- 
diness of his feet alone revealed. But what surprised 
him still more was the sudden changes of temperature. 
At the foot of the shaft it was very fresh, and in the 
wagon line through which passed all the air of the 



GERMIÎfAL. 37 

mine there blew a cold wind whose force wjis like a gale 
between the narrow walls ; then as they passed into the 
other drifts, which received onl}' their alloted portion 
of the air, the wind ceased, it grew hot, a choking heat, 
heavy as lead. For a quarter of an hour they had gone 
on and on through these narrow passages; and they 
were now entering into a more oven-like pit, blinding 
and melting. 

Maheu no longer opened his mouth. He went into 
a drift simply saying to Etienne, without turning 
round : ** 

" The vein Guillaume/^ 

This was the vein where the lead was discovered. 

From the first step Etienne struck his head and el- 
bows. The sloping ceiling dropped so low as to be only 
twenty or thirty metres high in some places, making it 
necessary to walk doubled up. The water came up to 
their ankles. 

His breath left him for an instant for the heat still 
increased. They proceeded thus two hundred metres 
when suddenly he saw Levaque, Zacharie and Catherine 
disappear, who seemed to be sv.-allowed up in a small 
fissure opening before him. 

" We must go up," said Maheu. " Put your lamp on 
a button and hold on to the wood." 

He also disappeared. Etienne was compelled to fol- 
low him. This opening left in the vein was reserved 
for the miners and cleared the whole second floor. It 
extended through the layer of coal more than sixty 
centimetres. Happily the young man was slight, for 
still awkard he drew himself up with difficulty, flatten- 
ing his shoulders and hips, pulling forward by the 
strength of his wrists, his hands clinging to the timber; 
at the end of fifteen metres they first came upon the 
second floor, but they must go on, the vein belonging to 
Maheu and his gang was at the sixth floor, " in Hell," 
as they said. The floors was ranged one above the other 
at distances of fifteen metres and the ascent still con- 
tinued straight tlirough that cleft which scraped the 
back and chest. Etienne was stifled as if the weight 
of the rocks rested upon him, his hands scratched, his 
legs bruised, his skin worn away so much that he could 



38 GERMINAL. 

feel the blood bursting out. Dimly in a path he per- 
ceived two doubled up beings, one small and one large 
who were pushing the cars, it was Lydie and Moquette 
already at work. But he must climb up to the highest 
part of the vein. The perspiration blinded him, he 
despaired of overtaking the others, whom he heard with 
agile limbs climbing the rock with a long glide. 

" Courage, here we are,"" said the voice of Catherine. 

But when he had really arrived, anotber voice cried 
at the end of the wall. 

"Well, what^s the matter? You don't think of any 
other folks. I have to come two kilometres from Mont- 
son, and I'm the first to get here." 

It was Cheval, a tall, thin man of twenty-five years, 
with strong features, who was angry "at being compelled 
to wait. When he perceived Etienne he inquired, with 
a contem])tuous air. 

*' Who's this? what does this mean?" 

And Maheu having told him the story, he added be- 
tween his teeth — 

"Then, the boys will take the bread from the girls!" 

The two men exchanged a glance lit with hatred, 
Avhich from intuition is felt on the instant. Etienne 
Lad felt the injury without being conscious of it. A 
silence reigned, then all set to work. The veins were 
at last filled. Little by little the leads were alive at 
each story, at the end of each path. The devouring 
shaft had swallowed its daily ration of men — almost 
seven hundred workmen who were laboring at that hour, 
in that huge swarm, boring holes in all parts of the 
earth; it was riddled like an old piece of wood filled with 
worms. And in the midst of a profound silence fol- 
lowing the crushing of the heavy layers, with the ear 
held close to the rock, one could hear the steps of the 
liuman insects in walking and the flight of cable which 
sent the hoisting cage up and down, and even the 
scratching of the tools cutting the coal, at the bottom 
of the felling-board. 

Etienne in turning around, found himself again 
pressed against Catherine. But this time he noticed 
the rising roundness of her neck and shoulders, he com- 
prehended immediately the warmth which he had felt. 



GERMIJSTAL. 39 

"Are you a girl?" murmured he, in astonishment. 
She responded with a gay air, without blushing: 
" Yes, it's true; but it's taken you a long time to find 
it out." 



CHAPTEE IV. 



The four diggers stretched themselves out one above 
the other, on each ledge in front of the drift. Separated 
by the hanging floors which kept back the coal_, each 
man occupied four metres of the vein; and that vein was 
so narrow, scarcely more than fifty centimetres wide, 
that they seemed flattened out between the roof and 
wall, dragging themselves along on their knees and 
elbows, unable to turn without knocking their shoulders. 
•They were obliged to mine the coal lying upon the side, 
the neck twisted, the arms raised in a slanting position, 
striking short blows with the pick. 

Zacharie worked nearest the gallery; over him was 
Chaval, then Levaque, and above all Maheu. Each, 
with his pick, removed the layer of slate found in the 
vein; when they had finally loosened the stratum upon 
the bottom, they made two vertical notches and then 
detached the blea by driving a gad of iron in the upper 
part. The coal was rich, the blea broke in pieces the 
length of their bodies. When these pieces, kept back 
by the board, were all heaped up, the diggers disap- 
peared, seeming to wall themselves up in the seam thus 
detached. 

Maheu was the greatest sufferer. Where he toiled the 
temperature was higher by thirty degrees, the air did 
not circulate, and at length the suffocation became 
more intolerable than the heat. His lamp, fastened to 
a stud above him enabled him to see clearly, but so 
warmed his head as to bring the blood to fever heat. 
But his anguish was increased by the dampness. From 
a rock some centimetres above his face, came a contin- 
ual and rapid dripping, in obstinate rythm, always 
falling in tlie same place. He threw his head back; 
the water beat against his face, streaming down, drip- 
ping over him without relaxation. In a quarter of an 
hour, v/ith perspiration and water combined, he v/as

wet through. That morning a drop fell in his eye 
causing him to swear. Unwilling to leave his position, 
he gave such heav}^ blows that the violent shaking of 
the rocks placed him in a position similar to a moth 
held between two leaves of a book, threatened with 
complete destruction. 

Not a word was exchanged. No sound was heard 
save the regular blows of the pick, muffled as though 
coming from a distance. Not an echo responded as the 
sounds came forth in the still air. Even the shadows 
were of an unknown darkness, dense with the flying 
coal-dust, rendered heavy by the gas which weighed 
upon the eye-lids. The lamp-wicks, under their cover 
of wire gauze, threw out only reddish gleams. Nothing 
was distinguishable, the drift arose like a large chimney, 
level, then oblique, where the soot of ten winters was 
heaped up, making a profound night. The dim lights 
fell on spectral forms, flitting to and fro, revealing 
rounded hips, knotty arms and heads smirched as though 
from a brawl. At times pieces of detached coal were 
suddenly lit up with a crystal-like reflection. Then 
darkness returned, while the heavy blows still continue, 
coupled with the panting of weary chests and groans of 
uneasiness and fatigue from the heavy air and falling 
water. 

Zacharie, weak from a wedding party of the night 
before, soon slackened his work, under pretext of being 
lame, and forgetting himself, he whistled softly, his eyes 
roving on the shadows. Behind the diggers, almost 
three metres of the vein remained cleared, without 
their having taken the precaution to sustain the rock 
above, heedless of the danger, and stingy of their time. 

"Halloo!" cried the young man to Etienne, ''give 
me some wood." 

Etienne, whom Catherine had taught to use his 
shovel, was obliged to carry up the wood into the drift. 
There was a small amount left tliere from the day be- 
fore. A portion, ready cut, was brought down to them 
every morning. 

"Hurry up now," cried Zacharie, seeing the new- 
comer awkwardly raising himself up among the coal, 
his arms encumbered with four pieces of oak. 

With his pick, he made a notch in the ceiling, and 



GEEMIJSrJLL. 41 

another in the wall ; and wedged in two pieces of wood, 
thus propping up the rock. In the afternoon other 
v/orkmen took the gobbing left at the end of the gal- 
lery by the diggers, and filled up the trench made in 
the vein where they saw the supports, arranging care- 
fully through the inferior and superior roads, over 
which the cars were pushed. 

Maheu paused, having at last detached his blea. He 
wiped his perspiring face upon his sleeve, uneasy at the 
work of Zacharie, behind him. 

" Leave that alone/' said he. "We'll see to it after 
lunch. . . . It'll be better to dig, if we want to 
have our number of cars." 

" This is sinking," responded the young man. "Look, 
there's a crack. I'm afraid its giving way." 

But his father shrugged his shoulders. "Ah, giving 
way! It wouldn't be the first time ; they'd get out of 
it all the same." He ended by becoming angry, and 
sending his son back in front of the drift. 

The others continued their work. Levaque, lying 
upon his back, was swearing ; a falling stone had cut 
his left thumb, from which the blood was flowing. 
Chaval, overheated, had removed his shirt, and was now 
at work naked to the waist. The perspiration, added 
to the fine coal dust which blackened them, ran in 
streams down their half naked bodies. Maheu was the 
first to again commence striking, lower down, his head 
close to the rock. Now the drops falling upon his face 
so persistently seemed to pierce his skull. 

" It ain't worth while to watch them," said Catherine 
to Etienne. " They'll always yell." 

And the obliging girl resumed her instructions. Each 
loaded car arrived at the top just as it set out from the 
drift, marked with a special character, so that the re- 
ceiver could put it on the account of that section. 
Thus, they were obliged to be very careful in filling it 
only to take the good coal or it would be rejected at the 
office. 

The young man, whose eyes had become habituated 
to the obscurity, watched her, so pallid with her taint 
of chlorosis; and he could not have told h.er age, not 
more than twelve years io him it seemed, she looked so 
frail. However, from her boyish liberty, she appeared 



43 GERMINAL. 

older, with a naïve boldness which slightly embarrassed 
him; she did not please him, she was too much of a 
boy. But that which astonished him most was the 
strength of that child, a nervous but skillful strength. 
She filled her car more quickly than he, lifting her 
shovel with rapid regularity; then she pushed it as far 
as the inclmed plane, with a slow thrust, without im- 
pediment, passing at her ease under the lowest rocks. 
His car, frequently becoming derailed, added to his 
perplexity. 

In truth it was not an easy road. It was sixty metres 
from the drift to the inclined plane; and the road, which 
the repairers had not yet enlarged, Avas a mere passage 
way, while the uneven ceiling was filled with projections 
of coal. At certain places, which the filled cars passed 
through, the pusher was obliged to shove the car by 
crouching down upon his knees to keep from splitting 
his scull, while at other points the timber was bent and 
already cracked. They saw it along the walls, split in 
the middle, in long thin pieces like invalids crutches. 
Ca''e vvas necessary to avoid rubbing off the skin against 
these projections, and ov/ing to the heavy pressure from 
above, pieces as large as a man's thigh frequently flew 
off, causmg the workmen to lie flat down, not knowing 
how soon they might be crushed. 

"Again!" said Catherine, laughingly. 

Etienne's car had just gone off the rails in the most 
difficult passage. He had not yet learned to push 
straight, upon these rails which had become twisted by 
the soft earth; and he swore, he flew into a passion, sav- 
agely fighting with the wheels, which in spite of the 
most severe efforts, he could not replace. 

" Wait now," said the young girl. " If you get mad 
it'll never go right. 

Having placed a chock under the wheels of her own 
car, she adroitly crept by him and with a slight lifting 
of her back, raised the car onto the track. It weighed 
seven hundred kilogrammes. He, surprised and ashamed, 
stammered an excuse. 

She was compelled to show him how to brace himself 
against the timber on each side of the gallery, thus giv- 
ing a solid means of support. The body should be bent, 
the arms stiff, in order to give the full strength to the 



GERMIJSTAL. 43 

muscles of the shoulders and thighs in pushing. Dur- 
ing one trip he kept behind, to observe her muuner of 
working, with lower limbs bent and the hands low, she 
seemed to walk on four paws, like one of those dwarf 
beasts who travel in the circus. She perspired, panting 
for breath, cracking in all the joints, but without a 
murmur, with the indifference of habit, as if the com- 
mon lot of all was to live thus bent up. His shoes 
annoyed him, he suffered from walking with head bent 
down. At length this position became a torture, an in- 
tolerable agony, so painful that he fell on his knees for 
an instant, to hold up his head and breathe. 

Then at the inclined plane came a new drudgery. 
She taught him to load his car quickly. Above and 
below that plane, which was used by all the drifts from 
one story to the otlier, a boy was placed, the sender 
above, the receiver below. These rogues of twelve or 
thirteen years were always screaming, and to warn them 
it was necessary to shout still louder. Then when there 
was an empty car to go up, the receiver gave the signal, 
the sender loosened his brake and the car, iilled by the 
pusher, descended by gravity, bringing the empty car 
up. In the gallery below, the trains which the horses 
drew to the foot of the shaft were formed. 

"Hello, there!" cried Catherine down the plane, 
wooded the length of a hundred metres, which re- 
sounded like a huge speaking trumpet. 

The boys must have lain down, for there was no re- 
sponse. At each story the wheeling was arrested. A 
shrill girlish voice called out: 

"You can bet this is Mouquette's fault." 

Mocking laughs broke out. 

"Who's that?" said Etienne to Catherine. 

She told him it was little Lydie, a child who knew as 
much and wheeled her car as well as any woman, in 
spite of her doll-like arms. 

But suddenly the voice of the sender was heard, giv- 
ing the order to start. Without doubt an overseer was 
passing above. The rolling was resumed at the nine 
floors, the only sound heard w^as the regular calls of the 
boys, and the panting of the jjushers "who Avere arriv- 
ing at the plane, utterly exhausted. 

And, at each trip, Etienne again noticed the closeness 



44 GERMINAL. 

at the bottom of the drift, the dull, broken thud of the 
picks, the great, heavy sighs of the diggers, obstinately 
bent ou their work. These nearly nude men were com- 
pletely covered with a black mud. Then he was obliged 
to assist Maheu, who was hauling away the plank to 
allow the coal to slide down upon the track. Zacharie 
and Levaque were in a rage at the vein, which, they 
said, had become dirty, rendering their work valueless. 
Cheval turned around to abuse Etienne, whose presence 
exasperated him. 

'' You're a fine one ; you haven't the strength of a 
girl ! . . . Ah ! can you fill your cart ? Well, 
there's nothing like being saving of one's arms. . . . 
Good heavens ! I'm willing to lose ten sous if you make 
two for us." 

The young man refrained from replying, only too 
happy at having found this galley-slave work, williug to 
accept the brutal treatment of both workman and over- 
seer. But he could work no more ; his feet were bleed- 
ing, his limbs racked with terrible cramps, his body as 
if pressed in a vice. Happily, it was ten o'clock, and 
the workmen decided to lunch. 

Maheu had a watch which he did not even consult. 
At the bottom of that starless night he was never mis- 
taken as to time ; he could tell it within five minutes. 
All resumed their shirts and vests. Then descending 
from the drift they crouched down, their elbows at their 
sides, sitting on their heels, a position so habitual to 
miners that they took it even when out of the mine, 
without seeing the need of even a stone to sit upon. 
And each one having taken out a sandwich, gravely bit 
into the thick slice, letting slip a few words upon the 
work of the morning. Catherine, who liad remained 
standing, at last joined Etienne, who, a short distance 
off, had stretched himself out across some rails, his 
back against the wood, where it was less damp. 

"Why don't you eat?" she asked, with mouth full 
and sandwich in her hand. 

Then she remembered Etienne wandering about in 
the darkness, without a sou or a morsel of bread. 

" Won't you share with me?" 

And when he refused, swearing he was not hungry. 



GERMIKAL. 45 

his voice trembling with the cravings of his stomach, 
she said gayly: 

"Ah! so you're disgusted! But, hold on! I've only 
bit into that side; I'll give you the other part.'" 

She had already broken the slices in two. The young 
man took his hulfj^ controlling himself, so as not to de- 
vour it in one mouthful; and he placed his hands upon 
his hips, so that she could not see them tremble. With 
her tranquil air of hon camarade she had thrown her- 
self down beside him, flat on her stomach, her chin in 
one hand, slowly eating from the other. Their lamps 
betw^een them lit them up. 

Catherine regarded him a moment in silence. She 
began to think him handsome, with his fine features 
and black mustache; she smiled. 

" So you're a machinist, and they've sent you away 
from your shops. . . . Why?" 

" Because I slapped my boss." 

She was amazed; her inherited ideas of subordination 
and passive obedience were upset. 

"I must own up I was drunk," continued he, ^' and 
when I drink it makes me crazy; why, I'd eat myself 
and everybody else. ... I can't take two little 
glasses without wanting to fight. . . . And I was 
sick for two days." 

"You musn't drink," said she, seriously. 

"Ah! don't be afraid; I know myself." 

And he shook his head, he had a hatred of rum, the 
hatred of the last child of a race of drunkards, whose 
nature suffered all that burning thirst produced by 
alcohol, knowing that the least drop was, for him, a 
poison. 

" It's on account of my mother that I'm annoyed at 
having been put out in the street," said he after having 
swallowed a mouthful. *' My mother is not well off, and 
every once in a while I send her a hundred sous." 

"Where is your mother? " 

" In Paris. . . . She's a wash-woman, in the 
rue de la Goutte d'Or." 

He was silent. When he thought of these things his 
black eyes gleamed with sharp pain, as he brooded over 
injury received. For an instant, his looks were lost in 
the depths of the mnie's shadows; and in that darkness, 



46 GERMINAL. 

under the weight and confinement of the earth above, 
he agitin saw his childhood, his mother, still pretty and 
healthy, cast off by his father and then taken back 
again, after having been married to another, living be- 
tween the two men who ruined her, and, at last, ended 
with them in the gutter, in wine and filth. He recalled 
the street; some details came back to him, the dirty 
linen in the middle of the shop, some drunken men 
who gathered at the house and the boxing which almost 
broke his ears. 

** Now," resumed he in a low voice, " I shall not be 
able to give her much otit of thirty sous. . . . She 
will die in misery, that's certain." 

He shrugged his shoulders in despair; then again bit 
into his sandwich. 

*' Won't you have a drink?" asked Catherine, who was 
holding her pail to her lips. " Oh! its coffee; that'll do 
you no harm. You'll choke without something to wash 
down the bread." 

But he refused. It was bad enough for him to have 
taken half of her bread. However, she insisted in a 
good-natured way, saying: 

" Well, I'll drink before you, if your so polite. . . . 
Only it would be mean to refuse any longer." 

She tendered him her pail, kneeling down beforehim, 
lit up by the yellov/ rays of the two lamps. Why had he 
thought her ugly? Now that she was black, her face cov- 
ered with coal dust, to him she seemed to have a singular 
charm. In the half gloom, the teeth in her large mouth 
were of a dazzling whiteness, her eyes grew larger, shining 
with a greenish reflection, like the eyes of a cat. A mass of 
auburn hair which had escaped from the pail delighted 
him, and he laughed quietly. She no longer appeared 
so young, she was at least fourteen. 

" To please you," said he, drinking and returning the 
pail. 

She again drank, then forced him to take another 
swallow, wishing to divide; and that pail going from one 
to the other amused them. Suddenly he asked himself 
if he ought not to seize her in his arms and kiss her 
upon the lips. She had full lips of a pale rose color, 
heightened by the coal dust, which tempted him with 
an increasing passion. But he dared not, he was 



GERMIÎTAL. é*? 

abashed before her. In Lille he had only had the lowest 
kind of girls, ignorant, such as one would expect to 
mate with a workman. 

''You're about fourteen, are you not?'' he asked, 
after going back to his bread. 

She was surjirised and somewhat angry. 

"How much? Fourteen! Why, I'm sixteen! . . . 
It's true, I'm not very large. The girls here don't 
grow much." 

He continued to question her; she spoke of every- 
thing without boldness or shame. Though she was not 
ignorant of anytliing pertaining to man and woman, he 
instinctively perceived she was of virgin purity. AVhen 
he spoke of Monquette, to embarrass her, she related 
some dreadful stories — her quiet voice becoming ani- 
mated. Ah! that one had done some terrible things! 
And when he asked her if she had not a lover, she 
answered playfully that she did not wish to annoy her 
mother, but that would come some day. Ilor clothing, 
wet with perspiration, caused her to shiver slightly. 
She shrugged her shoulders in a resigned manner as 
though ready to endure anything. 

"They don't lack lovers when they live all together, 
do they?" 

"No indeed." 

" Then that don't hurt any one. . . . They 
needn't tell the priest." 

" Oh! the priest, I don't care for him! . , . But 
there's the black man." 

"What black man?" 

" The old miner who comes back in the mines and 
wrings the necks of the bad girls." 

He looked at her, fearing she was making game of 
him. 

"Do you believe that nonsense; don't you know any- 
thing?" 

" Of course; I know how to read and write. . . . 
Tliat's very useful in our house, for in my father's and 
mother's time they didn't learn such things." 

She was certainly very nice. When she finished her 
slice of bread he would take her in his arms and kiss 
her on her large rosy lips. It was a timid resolution, a 
thought of violence, which made him slightly uncom- 



48 GEEMINAL. 

fortable. Those boys' clothes on that girlish form made 
him feel iineasy. He swallowed his last mouthful, and 
again drinking from the tin pail, he gave it to her to 
empty. Now the moment to act had come. He was 
slyly glancing toward the miners below him, Avhen a 
shadow darkened the gallery. 

For some time Cheval had been watching them from 
a distance ; then assuring himself that Maheu was not 
looking he came forward, and seizing Catherine by the 
shoulders, he turned back her head to cover her mouth 
with a brutal kiss, tranquilly affecting not to have seen 
Etienne. In that kiss there was a taking possession — a 
sort of jealous decision. 

But the young girl was disgusted. . 

" Leave me alone, will you !" 

He held up her head, looking straight into her eyes. 
His red mustache and beard partially covered his black 
face, while his big nose stood out like the beak of an 
eagle. At last he loosened her, and went off without 
a word. 

Etienne was seized with a chill. It was stupid to 
have waited. He could not embrace her now, or she 
would believe that he wished to treat her like that 
other. At last in his hurt vanity he felt a real despair. 

"Why have you lied?" said he in a low voice. 
*' That's your lover." 

" No, I swear to you," cried she. " There's nothing 
between us. Sometimes he wants to fool. . . . 
Besides he's only been here six months, from Pas-de- 
Calais." 

Both had risen, about to begin work again. When 
she saw him so cold, she was chagrined. Without 
doubt, she thought him handsomer than the others; 
she would have preferred him. The thought of a 
reconciliation arose in her mind, and when the young 
man, still angry, was examining his lamp which was 
burning with a pale, blue flame, she tried to attract his 
attention. 

*' Come on, I'll show you something," murmured she 
good-naturedly. 

When she had led him to the end of the drift, she 
showed him a crevice in the coal. A slight bubbling 
arose from it and a little noise like the whistling of a bird. 



GERMINAL. 49 

" Put your hand there, you can feel the wind. . .• 
It's fire-damp. " 

He was surprised. Was that the terrible fire-damp 
which made everything explode? She laughed, saying 
there was a great deal of it that day, and that was the 
reason the lamps burued so blue. 

" When will you fools stop your tongues?" cried the 
rough voice of Mahcu. 

Catherine and Etienne hastened to refill their cars, 
and push thern to the inclined plane, their backs bent, 
crawling under the uneven ceiling of the track. From 
the second trip, the perspiration soaked them and their 
bones cracked anew. 

In the drift the work of the diggers was resumed. 
They often cut short their lunch so as not to chill them- 
selves, and their sandwiches, eaten thus far from the 
sun, with speechless voracity, filled their stomachs as if 
with lead. Stretched out upon their sides, they dug 
still harder, having only one fixed idea, that of com- 
pleting a great day's work. Everything else disappeared 
in the struggle for gain so rudely contested. They 
ceased to feel the water dripping upon their limbs, the 
cramps from the forced attitude, always the same, the 
blackness of the night wliere they withered like plants 
buried in a cave. In proportion, as the day advanced, 
the air became more vitiated from the smoke of the 
lamps, the impure breaths and the gas from the fire- 
damp, weighing down the eyelids like cobwebs. All 
this combined was sufficient to destroy the effect of any 
pure air. Each one, buried in his molehole under the 
earth, with scarcely a breath in his weary body, still 
toiled on. 



CHAPTER V. 



Maheu, without consulting the watch which was left 

in his vest, said: 

''Almost an hour. Zacharie, is that done?" 

The young man paused, but remained upon his back, 

his wandering eyes running over the line of arches 

which he had made the day before; then he awoke from 

his stupor and replied: 
4 



50 GEE2IINAL. 

■ " Yes, that'll do till to-morrow." 

Atid he went back to his work in the drift. Levaque 
and Cheval also seized their picks. There was a pause; 
then, wiping their faces upon their bare arms, they 
looked at the rock above them from which protruded 
great masses of slate. Work was the only topic of con- 
versation. 

" Another chance of being buried under the earth," 
murmured Cheval. *' It don't make any difference to 
the company, though." 

" Thieves! " growled Levaque. " They're always try- 
ing to get the best of us." 

Zacharie was laughing. He made fun of everything, 
and it amused him to hear the company abused. In his 
quiet way, Maheu explained that for tvventy metres the 
whole nature of the rock was changed. It was best to 
be just; they could foresee nothing. Then, when the 
two others continued to rail against their chiefs, he be- 
came uneasy, looking around him. 

"Hold your tongues! You've said enough now!" 

"You're vight," said Levaque, lowering his voice. 
"It's risky to Uilk like that." 

A fear of spies constantly haunted them, even in that 
darkness, as if the stock-holders' coal, still in the veins, 
had ears. 

"I don't care," added Cheval, in a loud voice, with 
an air of defiance, " but if that pig Dansaert speaks to 
me the way he did the other day, I'll fling a stone at 
him. I don't hinder him from making love to the 
blonde." 

This time, Zacharie roared. The love of the super- 
intendent for the wife of Pierron was a continual cause 
for mirth in the mine. Even Catherine, at the foot of 
the drift, leaned upon her shovel, her sides shaking 
with laughter; but Maheu became angry, filled with 
fear he could no longer conceal. 

"Are you going to shut up? Wait till you're alone 
if you want to speak of such things." 

He was still speaking when the sound of feet was 
heard in the upper gallery. Almost immediately the 
mine engineer, the little nigger, as the v/orkmen called 
him, appeared at the top of the drift, accompanied by 
Dansaert, the superintendent. 



GERMIÎs^AL. 61 

'•What did I say," muttered Maheu. "Speak of 
the devil and his imps will appear." 

Paul Megrel, the nephew of M. Hennebeau, was a 
slight, handsome man of twenty-six years, with curly 
hair and black mustache. His pointed nose and bright 
eyes reminded ona of a sharp ferret; but his alïable 
air was changed into one of authority when dealing 
with the workmen. In miner's dress, like them, he 
was covered with coal-dust; and to command their re- 
spect, he assumed courage, running the risk of breaking 
his back in the most difficult part of the mine, always 
the first at a caving in, or in an explosion from fire- 
damp. 

" We are here, Dansaert, are we not?" said he. 

The superintendent, a Belgian, with a heavy face and 
large sensual nose, replied with an exaggerated polite- 
ness : 

*•' Yes, Monsieur Megrel. . . . Here is the man 
they engaged this morning." 

Then both passed into the drift opening. The en- 
gineer, going up to Etienne, raised his lamp and looked 
at him, without saying a word. 

"It's all right," said he at last. "But I don't like 
them to engage unknown peoi^le." 

He would not listen to the explanations given him, 
the necessity of the' work and the company's desire to 
replace the women wheelers with boys. He was look- 
ing intently at the ceiling, while the miners again took 
up their picks. Suddenly he cried : 

" Say, now, Maheu, have you no thought for people? 
You are going to bury us here like dogs." 

" Oh ! that's solid," responded the workman, quietly. 

" Solid ! . . . Why the rock is already sinking, 
and you grudge the time spent in placing props two 
metres apart ! Ah ! you would risk cracking your 
skulls rather than leave your vein to attend to' the 
timbering. I tell you to prop that up immediately. 
Double the supports; do you hear?" 

And, at the angry looks of the miners, who thought 
themselves good judges of their own safety, he quickly 
became angry. 

"Very well! When your heads are broken, do yon 
have to bear the consequences? Not at all; it is the 



Ô'Z GERJillXAL. 

company wlio will be obliged to give pensions either to 
you or to your wives. . . . They know you: to 
have two more cars in the evening you would give 
your lives." 

MaJieu, in spite of the anger which filled him, said 
composedly: 

*' If we were paid better, we would do more propping." 

The engineer shrugged his shoulders without reply- 
ing. Then going to the end of the drift he concluded: 

" There is an hour left yet, get to work, every one of 
you, or you shall each be fined three francs." 

A low growl from the miners followed this command. 
The governing power, upheld by military discipline, 
Avas felt by all in the mine, from the superintendent 
down to the smallest boy. Clieval and Levaque shook 
their fists, while Maheu checked them witli a look and 
Zacharie shrugged his shoulders in disgust. But Etienne 
shook with anger. Each moment spent in that hell 
filled him with revolt. He looked at Catherine, patient, 
with bent back. Could it be possible that they were 
killing themselves by inches, toiling in these shadows, 
and then not getting the few sous for their daily bread? 

Megrel, who had gone avvay with Dansaert, contented 
himself, whenever approving, with a nod of the head. 
Again their voices were heard. They had paused once 
more, and were examining the propping on the road, 
six metres of which the miners were obliged to keep in 
repair. 

''Did I not tell yon they cared for nothing?" cried 
the engineer. '' Why don't you watch them?" 

"I am weary of saying the same thing over and 
over," exclaimed the superintendent. 

Megrel screamed loudly: 

"Maheu! Maheu!" 

Then still going on he continued: 

" See here, is that the way that should be done. . . 
You economize timber to economize time. I under- 
stand that the timbering costs us a great deal, and, if 
that would stand it would be all right. But it is bound 
to break, and then the company is forced to employ an 
armv of repairers. . . . Just look there; why, it is 
terrible." 

Cheval wished to speak, but he made him keep silent. 



GERMINAL. 53 

"'No, I know what you are going to say. That we 
should pay you more. Well, I warn you that you will 
force us to make a change. Yes, we will pay you in 
part for the timbering, and we will reduce the price of 
the cars in proportion. We shall see if you win. . . 
In the meantime, prop that up at once, I will pass 
here to-morrow. '' 

And with that threat he moved off. Dansaert so 
humble before him, remained behind a second, saying 
to the men: 

" You've made me catch it. . . . I'll fine you 
more than three francs, if you don't look out. 

Then, when he had gone, Maheu broke out: 

''Great God! that is not just. I believe in being 
calm, but they would make any one violent. . 
Have you heard? the cars cut down and a percentage for 
the timbering! it is only another plan to pay us less." 

He was looking for some one on whom to vent his 
anger, when he perceived Catherine and Etienne swing- 
ing their arms. 

"Are you going to give me some timber? I suppose 
this has amused you." 

Etienne went after a load, so furious at the chiefs, 
that he did not notice the rage of the miner. 

Levaque and Cheval swore roundly, even Zacharie 
had savagely gone to work at the timbering. For 
nearly a half hour nothing was heard but the cracking 
of wood, wedged in with blows of a mallet. Not a 
word was exchanged ; they were breathing heavily, ex- 
asperated at the rock, which they would have torn out 
and raised higher with their shoulders had they been 
able to lift the extra weight. 

"That's enough," said Maheu at last, worn out with 
rage and fatigue. " One hour and a half. . . . Ah! 
this has been a good day ; v;e've not made fifty sous ; 
I'm discouraged." 

There was only a half hour for work left ; he dressed 
himself, the others doing the same. The very sight of 
the drift irritated them. When the wheeler went on 
with her work, they called her back, angry at her zeal ; 
they were through for that day, and all six, their tools 
under their arms, started out, on their return to the 



54 GERMINAL. 

sluift, through the same openings which they had fol- 
lowed in the morning. 

In the piissage Catherine and Etienne paused, meet- 
ing little Lydie, who had stopped in the opening to let 
tliem pass. She told them of the disappearance of 
Moquette, who an hour before had been taken with a 
bleeding at the nose ; she had gone somewhere to bathe 
her face, and they could not tell what had become of 
her. When they left her, the child, tired out, with ach- 
ing back, again began pushing her car, her insect-like 
arms and limbs reminding one of a thin, black ant 
moving a burden too large for its size. 

The lower gallery was deserted. In the distance red 
lights were disappearing on one side of the road. They 
were no longer cheerful; they walked with the heavy 
step of fatigue, slie in front, he following. The lights 
were growing dim; he conld scarcely distinguish her, 
enveloped as she was in a kind of smoky fog. Think- 
ing of her, he was vexed. Why had she lied to him ? 
That man was her lover. They were both stooping in 
order to avoid the projections above them. Without 
cause he felt angry with her. But every little while 
she, turning around, warned him of an obstacle, as 
though asking him to be amiable. They were alone ; 
why should tliey not be good friends ? Finally, when 
they came out upon the main gallery, for him it was a 
relief from the indecision which he suffered ; while she 
gave one last sad look, a regret for happiness which 
they could never recover. 

Now, around them the underground road resounded 
with the continual passing of the people, and the going 
and coming of the cars, carried along by the trotting 
horses. Lamps shone out like stars at night. They 
were obliged to shrink back against the rock, leaving 
the road to the seeming shadows of men and beasts, 
whose breath they felt in passing. Jeanlin, with bare 
feet, running behind his train, cried something to his 
sister, which they did not hear in the thundering of the 
wheels. They still went on. She had become si- 
lent, while he, not remembering the cro^s-roads, im- 
agined she was misleading him more and more ; now 
he suffered from the cold, a chill which came over 
him when he left the drift, and which made him shiver 



GERMINAL. 55 

the harder as he approached the shaft. Between the 
narrow walls the air blew violently. He was in despair 
of ever arriving, when, suddenly, they pulled themselves 
up by their hands into the main room of the floor. 

Cheval threw on them a sidelong glance of distrust. 
The otliers were there, still perspiring in the cold draft, 
silent, restraining their low mutterings. They had ar- 
rived too soon, and v/ere unable to go up for a half 
hour, perhaps longer, because of the arrangements for 
the descent of a horse. The loaders were still filling 
their cars, with a deafening noise, and the cages were 
swallowed up, disappearing in the beating shower which 
fell into the black hole. Below, the sump, a water 
sump of ten metres, filled by this falling stream, also 
seut towards him its thick dampness. Some men were 
ceaselessly movmg around the shaft, pulling the signal 
cords, pressing hard upon the levers, amidst that stream 
of water by which their clothing was soaked. A red- 
dening light, revealing great moving shadows, fell from 
the three open lamps, giving to that subterranean 
chamber the air of a villainous cavern, the home of 
bandits on the edge of a stream. 

Malien made a last effort; he approached Pierron who 
had gone to work at six o'clock. 

''Say, you might just as well let us go up." 

But the loader, a splendid fellow, with strong limbs 
and kind face, refused with an angry gesture. 

" Impossible, ask the overseer . . . They'd fine 
me." 

Fresh mutterings were stifled. Catherine whispered 
in the ear of Etienne. 

"Come and see the stables. It's nice there." 

They escaped without being seen, for it was forbidden 
to go there. The stable was on the left, at the end of a 
short gallery. Twenty-five metres in length and four 
in width, hewn out of the rock and arched over with 
bricks, holding twenty horses. It was indeed nice there, 
a good odor of fresh litter, properly cared for. One 
light burned softly as a night-lamp. Some horses 
turned their great child-like eyes upon them, then, 
satisfied, went back to their oats in peace, laborers, fat 
and healthy, loved by all the world. 

While Catherine was reading aloud the names over 



56 GERMINA.L. 

each stall, she gave a slight cry on seeing some one 
suddenly stand erect before her. It was Mouquette^ 
who had fallen out of a heap of straw where she ha.] 
been sleeping. Mondays, weary from the folic of Sun- 
day, she gave her nose a violent blow with her fist, then, 
leaving her work under the pretext of going to find 
some water, she came there, to lie down with the beasts 
in the warm litter. Her father who had a great weak- 
ness for the rogue, tolerated it at the risk of getting in 
trouble. 

Suddenly, old Moque entered; he was short, bald and 
scarred by time, but still remained fat, a rare thing 
among miners of fifty years. Since they had made him 
a groom he had chewed so much that even his gums had 
become discolored. When he perceived the two others 
he became angry. 

" What's the matter with you all? I don't want you 
to bring any man here in my stable. '^ 

Moquette, laughing, thought that funny. But Eti- 
enne went away, angry, Catherine following him. At 
length, when all three had returned to the main gallery, 
Bebert and Jeanlin had arrived with their train of cars. 
They paused at the cages, and the young girl ap- 
proached the horse to caress him, speaking to him as 
she would to a companion. It was Bataille, the oldest 
worker in the mine, a wliite horse that had been at the 
bottom six years. For six years he had lived in that 
hole, occupying the same corner of the stable, making 
the same shadow along the black galleries, without even 
having again seen the light of day. Very fat, his skin 
shone with an appearance of good health; he seemed 
here to pass a happy life, sheltered from the unhappi- 
ness above. He had become accustomed to the dark- 
ness. The track which he traversed was so familiar to 
him, that, with his head, he would push open the ven- 
tilating doors, and finally crouch down so as not to 
strike against the low places. He must also have count- 
ed his trips, for, when he had made the regular number, 
he refused to commence another, and they were com- 
pelled to take him back to his stall. Now old age had 
come, his cat-like eyes were occasionally clouded with 
sadness. Perhaps he vaguely beheld, as if in a dream, 
the last place where he toiled, the old mill at Mar- 



GEEMIXAL. 57 

chiennes, built upon the border of the Scarjae, surround- 
ed by green trees gently stirred by the wind ; dim 
recollections came up before him, and he stood, liis 
head down, trembling upon his old legs, making futile 
efforts to recall the rest. 

Meanwhile the wort went on at the shaft. The sig- 
nal of four blows was given for sending down the horse, 
filling him with emotion, for he had also arrived like 
that beast, seized with just such terror, disembarking 
almost dead. Above, v/hcn fastened by a cord, he had 
struggled desperately; then, as soon as he felt the ground 
giving way beneath him, he became as if petrified, dis- 
appearing without a movement, his eyes enlarged and 
fixed. This one was too large to pass between the 
guides, so they had been forced to suspend him from 
the under portion of the cage. The descent took four 
minutes; they had decreased the velocity as a precaution. 
Thus the fright was prolonged. Were they going to 
leave him on the road, lost in the night? At last he 
appeared, apparently lifeless, his great eyes dilated with 
terror. It was a bay liorse, about three years old, 
named Trompette. 

"Hold on!" cried Moque, whose duty it was to re- 
ceive him; "lead him off ; don't untie him yet." 

Soon, Trompette was in a heap upon the iron flagging. 
He did not stir, feeling as though in a nightmare, in 
that dark hole, that profound blackness, resounding 
with tumult. They had commenced to untie him, when 
Bataille, who had just been unharnessed, stretched out 
his neck to scent this companion who had thus fallen 
from the earth above. The enlarged group of workmen 
joked. Well! what good smell did he find? But Bataille 
was happy. He had found tlie good odor of the open 
air, the forgotten smell of the sun on the meadows. 
And, all at once, he broke forth into a deep snorting, a 
tone of joy, which almost seemed to die away in a sob. 
It was a welcome, a reminder of those old things a whiff 
of which had returned to break the melancholy of that 
more than prisoner, who would only ascend when dead. 

"Ah! that Bataille!" cried the workmen, overjoyed 
by these tricks of their favorite. "He's talking with 
his friend." 

Trompette, perfectly satisfied, had not yet moved. 



58 GERMINAL. 

He remained upon his side, as if he still felt the rope 
tied around him, pinching the skin. Finally, they 
made him stand up; he was astonished, his legs shaking 
with great chill. And old Moque led away the two 
beasts who had fraternized. 

*'Are we ready now?" asked Maheu. 

It was necessary to unload the cages, and at any rate, . 
it still wanted ten minutes of the hour for descending. 
Little by little the drifts were emptied of the m.inors 
who returned by all the galleries. There were already 
fifty wet and shivering men there. Pierron, in spite of 
his kind face, boxed the ears of his daughter Lydie, 
because she had left the drift too early, Zacharie was 
slily ■ pinching Moquette. But the - discontent grew 
greater. Cheval and Levaque were relating the threats 
of the engineer, "the cars cut down in price, the tim- 
bering to be paid for in part," and many exclamations 
greeted this project. A rebellion was cropping out in 
this corner nearly six hundred metres below the earth. 
These men, stained with coal and chilled with waiting, 
accused the company of killing one half of its workmen 
below and starving the other half. Etienne listened, 
shivering. 

" Hurry up! hurry upl" said Eichomme, one of the 
overseers, to the loader. 

He hastened the work, not wishing to be guilty of 
cruelty, pretending not to have heard their words. 
However, the murmurs had become such that he was 
forced to put a stop to them. Behind him they were 
saying that it would not always be like this, and some 
fine morning the mine would explode. 

"You are reasonable," said he to Maheu, "do make 
those others be silent. When one is not the strongest 
he should be the most patient." 

But Maheu, although he had become calm himself, 
was still dissatisfied, and would not interfere. Suddenly 
the voices ceased; Dansaert and the little Megrel were 
returning from their inspection at the end of the gal- 
lery, both covered with perspiration. The habit of dis- 
cipline made the men fall in line, while the engineer 
passed through without a word. By a slight gesture he 
made known his wish to go up, and Pierron, who had 
prudently disappeared during the tumult, came forward. 



GERMIISTAL. 59 

The little nigger jumped into one car, Dansaert in 
another; the signal was given four times, and the cage 
ascended in the midst of a sullen silence. 



CHAPTER VI. 



While going up in the cage with four others, look- 
ing like dirty bundles, Etienne resolved to resume his 
journey and famish on the roads. As well starve at 
once as to again descend to the bottom of that hell, 
and then not even earn his bread. Catherine, shrouded 
in darkness above him, was no longer by his side. But 
he must not think of such foolishness ; for, with a 
deeper insight, he could not feel the resignation of these 
people, and, in the end, would strangle some official. 

Suddenly, his eyes, habituated to the gloom below, 
were blinded by the transition to daylight. It was 
none the less a relief for him to feel the cage firmly 
secured. The door was opened, and the group of work- 
men sprang from the cars. 

" Don't forget, Moquet," whispered Zacharie to a 
young man, '•' this evening at the Volcan.'" 

The Volcan was a concert garden at Montson. Mo- 
quet laughed, winking his left eye. Short and fat, like 
his father and sister, he had the greedy air of a boy 
who ate all he could get, without thought of the morrow. 

At that moment his sister, jumping from the cage, 
playfully slapped him on the back. 

Etienne scarcely recognized the superintendent's 
office, last seen by him in the dim light of a lantern. 
It was very dirty. The daylight struggled through the 
dusty windows. The engine, alone, was bright ; the 
steel cables, covered with grease, slid off like ribbon 
dipped in ink ; and the drums above, the heaving frame- 
work which supported them ; the cages ; the cars, all 
increased the somber appearance of that room. The 
flagging constantly shook with ceaseless rolling of 
wheels, while, from the ascending coal, arose a fine 
black dust, covering the floor and walls as far as the 
tower. 

Cheval, who had gone to look at the tally-list in the 
superintendent's office, returned furious. He saw that 



60 GERMINAL. 

two cars had been rejected, one deficient in quantity 
the other inferior in qiuilit}', 

" WeVe done well to-day," he cried. ''Twenty sous 
lost. . . . This is what we get for taking in lazy 
people, who use their arms as a hog does its tail! " 

His side-long glance was directed to Etienne, as he 
finished the sentence. The latter was about to respond 
with a blow of the fist; then he asked himself what was 
the use when he was going to leave. That thought 
restrained him. 

"Nobody can do well right off," said Maheu, to keep 
peace. " It'll be better to-morrow." 

Still they were angry, anxious to quarrel. When 
they stopped to give their lamps to the- keeper, Levaque 
swore at the man, whom he accused of slighting his 
work. But their anger abated somewhat in the wait- 
ing room, before the newly replenished fire, the reflec- 
tion of which, upon the walls of that huge windowless 
hall, seemed to fill it wùth flames. Turning their backs 
to the reddening coals, for the moment, all was forgot- 
ten, save that they were warm. 

"I'm going," said Cheval, laying his tools back in 
his chest and putting on his shoes. 

No one replied. But Mouquette ran off behind him. 
The others sneered, knowing he was through with lier; 
and Zacharie turned towards his sister with a laugh. 

Meanwhile Catherine was talking to her father in a 
low tone. He appeared surprised, then gave an ap- 
proving nod of the head, and calling Etienne, gave him 
his bundle. 

"Listen," said he; " if you havn't a sou 5-ou''ll starve 
before pay-day. . . . Don't you want me to get 
credit for you somewhere?" 

The young man was embarrassed. Just at that mo- 
ment he was going to ask for his thirty sous and leave. 
But pride prevented his doing so before the young girl. 
She watched him closely, thinking he was sulky. 

" You know, I don't promise you anything," continued 
Maheu, "they can't do more than refuse us though." 

Then Etienne consented. They would not keep him 
without money; he would eat something, and then go 
away. But on seeing Catherine's joy he regretted not 



GERMINAL. 61 

having said no; with a friendly glance she smiled, 
happy in the thought that she had helped him. 

As they became warm, putting on their shoes again, 
one by one the miners left the room. Levaque and the 
Maheues, shutting up their chests, went oiï together. 
But, when they arrived.at the screening shed, a quarrel 
arrested them. 

It was in a large shed, the black beams of Avhich were 
covered with coal-dust, with great windows, through 
which a current of air continually passed. The cars, 
brought here by boys, were emptied upon iron hojopers, 
on the right and left of which the screeners, armed 
with a shovel and rake, and mounted upon platforms 
of piled-ap stones, pushed forward the good coal which 
finally fell through funnels into the wagons placed 
under the shed. 

Philoméne Levaque, a small, pale girl with the 
slender form of a consumptive, her face projecting from a 
blue woolen rag, and her hands and arms black as far as 
the elbow, assisted the mother of Pierron in sorting 
the coal, the Brule, as they called her, who was a terrible 
old hag, with eyes like a screech-owl, and mouth drawn 
up as tight as the purse of a miser. These two were 
quarreling; the girl accused tlie old woman of stealing 
her coal. This was a continual cause of strife, as they 
were paid by the basket. 

'•' Knock a hole in her!" cried Zacharie from above, 
to his girl. 

The screeners alllaughed. The Brule answered back: 

"You'd better mind your own business." 

Maheu tried to prevent his son from interfering; but 
at that moment an overseer came forward and all set to 
work again screening the coal. 

Outside, the wind had suddenly calmed, but a cold 
dampness fell from the gray sky. The miners shrugged 
their shoulders, and separating, went forth swinging 
their arms. They had passed an entire day in the midst 
of dirt, and now came out black as negroes. 

"Look! here's Bouteloup," said Zacharie, laughing. 

Levaque, without stopping, exchanged a few words 
with his lodger, a large, dark man of thirty-five years, 
with a steady and honest mien. 

" Is there any soup, Louis? " 



62 GERMINAL. 

"I think SO." 

*'Tlien the old woman is in a good humor to-day?" 

*' Yes, I think she is." 

Other miners were arriving, a new set, who one by 
one were swallowed up in the mine. It was tliree o'clock, 
the time for another shift. The mine never rested; day 
and night human insects dug in the rock six hundred 
metres under the beet fields. 

The children had gone on before. Jeanlin was con- 
fiding to Bebert a plan for obtaining four sous' worth of 
tobacco; while Lydie follovred respectfully at a distance. 
Catherine walked with Zaoliarie and Etienne without 
saying a word. Before the tavern "A I' Avantage,'^ 
Maheu and Lavaque joined them. 

"Here we are, come on in," said the first to Etienne. 

As they separated, Catherine stood motionless for an 
instant, taking a last look at the young man, her eyes 
limpid like clear spring water; then, smiling, she went 
off with the others up the road leading to their alley. 

The tavern was at a cross-road between the mine and 
the village. It was a brick house, two stories high, 
whitewashed from top to bottom, and its windows orna- 
mented with large sky-blue sashes. Upon a hanging 
sign nailed above the door were the words: " A l'Avan- 
tage, Inn, kept by lîasseneur." 

In the rear, there was only a narrow yard, inclosed 
by a hedge. The company, which had endeavored to 
buy this place with its grounds, was greatly annoyed by 
this tavern, standing in the open field so near the exit 
of the mines. 

" Go in," said Maheu to Etienne. It was a small, 
bare room with white v/alls. There were a dozen 
chairs, three tables and a bar made of spruce, behind 
which was a half dozen different drinks, three bottles of 
liquor, a decanter, a little tin cash box and a pewter 
tap for the beer — this was all. Not a picture, not a 
shelf, not even a game-board was to be seen. In the iron 
fire-place, varnished and briglit, a block of. coal was 
slowly burning. The roof was covered with a layer of 
white sand which absorbed the moisture of that damp 
country. 

" Give me a drink," demanded Maheu, of a large 



GERMIKAL. 63 

blonde girl, whose heavy face was pitted with small- 
pox. *' Is Rasseneur here? " 

The girl, waiting on him, nodded her head. Slowly, 
without taking breath, the miner emptied half tlie 
glass to wash down the dust, which choked him. He 
offered his companion- nothing. One other customer 
was there, another wet and dirty miner, seated before a 
table drinking his beer in silence, with an air of pro- 
found meditation. At a gesture his third drink was 
served him, for which he paid; then, without having 
spoken a word, he went away. 

Just then, a large, clean-shaven man, about thirty- 
eight years of age, entered, a jolly smile breaking over 
his round face. It was Rasseneur, a miner whom the 
company had discharged as the leader of a strike which 
had taken place three years before. Being a good 
workman who spoke well, he soon became the chief of 
the miners. His wife already kept a shop, like many 
miners' wives; and, v/hen thrown out in the street, he 
became a tavern keeper, placing his saloon right in 
front of the Voreux as a menace to the company. His 
house, becoming a center, prospered, he enriched him- 
self by the wrath which he had, little by little, infused 
in his old comrades. 

" Here^s a fellow I engaged this morning," explained 
Maheu immediately. " Are either of your two rooms 
empty, and will you trust him till the fifteenth?" 

Easseneur's face at once became clouded. He glanced 
at Etienne and replied without hesitation : 

"It's impossible. My two rooms are taken." 

The young man, expecting such a refusal, was not in 
the least disappointed. He marveled at his great desire 
to leave, and yet v^as unwiliing to do so until he had re- 
ceived his thirty sous. One by one, other miners en- 
tered, and, after drinking, went off again alone. It 
was simply washing, without joy or pleasure. 

"Is there anything new?" asked Rasseneurof Maheu, 
who was slowly drinking his beer. 

The latter turned round, and seeing only Etienne, 
said: 

" They've been v/rangling again. It's about the tim- 
bering now." 

As he narrated the affair, the tavern-keeper's face be- 



04 GEEMINAL. 

came very red. Finally, with flashing eyes, he broke 
out: 

" Well, they are beasts if they lower the price." 

Etienne made him uncomfortable. He continued to 
eye him closely while speaking of the director, llenne- 
beau, his wife and nephew, little Megrel, without nam- 
ing them personally, saying it could not always con- 
tinue, the end was bound to come; the suffering was 
too great. He spoke of the works which were closed, 
the workmen who had gone away. For a month he had 
given out more than six loaves of bread a day. He had 
been told the evening before that M. Denneulin, the 
owner of a neighboring mine, feared he would be com- 
pelled to shut down. Moreover, he had just received a 
letter from Lille, filled with alarming details. 

"You know/' said he, "it came from that person 
you saw here one evening " 

His wife had just entered, a tall, thin, but good- 
hearted woman, with long nose and high cheek bones. 
She was more of a radical than her husband. 

"The letter from Pluchart," said she. "Ah! if he 
was master, it wouldn't be long before things would go 
better." 

Etienne listening, became excited with these sugges- 
tions of revenge. That name, coming out so suddenly, 
made him start, and without thinking he said aloud: 

" I know Pluchart.^'' 

They looked at him as he hastened to add: 

" Yes, I am a machinist, he was my foreman. A fine 
man. I've often talked with him.-" 

Rasseneur inspected him again and a quick change of 
sudden sympathy came over him. At length he said to 
his wife: 

" Maheu brought this man; he is a wheeler^ and he 
wants him to get a room here, and asks if we won't trust 
him till the fifteenth." 

Then the affair was settled in a few words. They 
had a room; the lodger had left that morning; and the 
tavern-keeper very much excited, insisted that he asked 
no more than was reasonable. His wife shrugged her 
shoulders, waiving her right to speak. 

"Good-night," said Maheu. "All this won't keep 
them from cutting down, and as long as they do that, 



GERMINAL. 65 

things will never mend. . . . Just think, you're a 
strong man, now that you've boen out of the mine three 
years." 

" Yes, I'm much better off," said Easseneur com- 
placeitly." 

Etienne went as far-as the door with the miner, thank- 
ing him; but the latter nodded his head without a 
word, and the young man watched him going quietly 
up the road to the alley. Mme. Rasseneui\ wishing 
to serve some customers, asked him to wait a minute 
and she would conduct him to the room where he could 
wash. Should he remain? Again he hesitated, with 
an uneasiness which made him long for the liberty of 
the highroads, a thirst for the sun as well as for the 
joy of being his own master. He felt as though some 
years had passed since his arrival there; and he hated 
to go back to those dark galleries to spend hours under 
the earth flat on his stomach. No, it was too hard, his 
pride revolted at the idea of being a beast that they 
first made blind and then wiped out altogether. 

While Etienne was thus debating in his mind, he all 
at once became aware of the immense plain before him» 
He was astonished; he had not imagined it was so large 
when old Bonnemort had indicated it with a gesture 
amid the shadows. Before him lay tlie Voreux in a pile 
of dirt, with its buildings of brick and wood, its tarred 
screening shed, the tower with its slate roof, the engine 
room and the high chimney of a light red — all rising 
out of the murky atmosphere. A pavement extended 
around the buildings. He had not thought it so large, 
changed by the coal-dust into an inky lake, spanned by 
bridges and encumbered in one corner by an accumula- 
tion of timber that reminded one of a felled forest. On 
the right, an old mine intercepted the view, colossal as 
a giant's barricade, already covered with grass on one 
side, but on the other, scorched by an interior fire 
which had burned for a year with a thick smoke, leav- 
ing on the surface slate and sandstone, with long trails 
of bloody fire-blast. Then the fields spread out before 
him, interminable fields of wheat and beets, but bare at 
that time of the year; and marshes with stunted wil- 
lows, while in the distance, thin rows of poplar trees

divided the plain, and, still farther off, were white spots 
indicating villages: Marchiennes on the north, Montson 
in front, while on the east the forest of Vandame, 
with its leafless trees bordered the horizon with a violet- 
colored line. Under the somber sky of that winter 
afternoon it seemed as though all the darkness of the 
Voreux, all the flying coal-dust, was thrown over that 
plain, powdering the trees, darkening the roads, cover- 
ing the entire earth. 

Etienne looked around, and that wliich surprised him 
above all, was a canal, which he had not observed in 
the night. From the Voreux to Marchiennes, a straight 
canal, two leagues m length extended like a silver rib- 
bon ; an avenue bounded with large trees, elevated 
above the low ground, going out into infinity with a 
perspective of green banks, while in its pale waters 
disported a multitude of fishes. ISTear the mine was a 
wharf, at which boats were moored, waiting to be 
filled from the cars ; then the canal made a bend, cut- 
ting across the marsh, a huge transport way for coal 
and iron. 

Etienne turned his eyes from the canal to the hamlet 
built upon the plain, of which he could only distin- 
quish the red roofs in long, regular lines, at the end of 
a bend in the road ; then they returned to the Voreux, 
pausing along the clayish slope at two enormous heaps 
of brick manufactured on the premises. A branch of 
the company's railroad passed lower down, turning at 
the mines. Doubtless this portion of the road had not 
been completed, for a number of men were pushing 
along a creaking car. It was no longer the unknown 
of the night shadows, with its inexplicable noises, 
and the flaming of strange looking liglits. In the dis- 
tance, the high furnaces and coke fires were subdued by 
the daylight.^ He stood motionless. The steam engine 
was puffing, with the same great, long breaths, and he 
now distinguished its ascending clouds of gray steam. 

And now his decision was reached. Perhaps he 
thought of again seeing Catherine's bright eyes- per- 
haps it was still more the sickening air which came 
from the Voreux; he did not know himself. But he 
longed to again descend to the bottom of that mine, to 



GEEMINAL. 67 

suffer with the others. He thought savagely of those 
people of whom old Bounemort had spoken, of that 
unknown God to whom ten thousand famishing jjeople 
were giving their lives without knowing him. 



CHAPTER VII. 



PoiFAiNE, the residence of M. Grégoire, was two 
kilometres east of Montson, on the road leading to 
Joiselle. It was a large, square, unpretending house, 
built at the beginning of the last century; but of the 
vast grounds which once surrounded it, only thirteen 
hectares remained, used as a garden that yielded the 
best fruit and vegetables in the whole country. A little 
wood extended over what, in former years, had been a 
park, while one of the greatest curiosities of that level 
plain, where one could count the large trees from Mar- 
chiennes to Beaugnies, was an avenue of old limes, 
forming an arch of leaves, reaching from the door-step 
to the road. 

This morning the Gregoires arose about eight o'clock 
— an hour earlier than usual, for the tempest of the 
night had unnerved them. 

During the absence of her husband, who had gone 
out to see what damage had been done by the storm, 
Mme. Grégoire, in her slippers and flannel dressing- 
gown, vœnt down into the kitchen. She was fifty-eight 
years of age, short, fat, and with a cheerful face, con- 
trasting strangely with the pale whiteness of her skin. 

"Melanie," said she to the cook, "if you have made 
the milk bread, my husband is ready. Mademoiselle 
will not rise for a half houi-, and she will eat it with her 
chocolate. . . . What a surprise it will be." 

The cook, a scrawny old woman, who had served 
them for thirty years, laughed. 

"That's true, 'twill be a surprise. . . . My fire 
is lit and the oven's getting hot ; and then Honorine's 
going to help me a little." 

Honorine, a girl of twenty years, who was taken 
when an infant and brought up in the house, now 
served as chambermaid. In addition to these two, there 



G8 GERMINAL. 

were a coachman, named Francois, a gardener, and a 
florist. Tliese domestics formed by themselves a little 
family, living together in good fellowship. 

Mme. Grégoire, who, while in bod had planned the 
surprise of the milk bread, waited to see the dough 
put in the oven. The large kitchen was kept scru})u- 
lously clean with its arsenal of sauce pans and other 
cooking utensils. There was an agreeable odor pervad- 
ing the whole room from the well-filled closets. 

''I hope you have put plenty of eggs in it,'' said 
Mme. Grégoire, as she passed into the dining-roum. 

In addition to the furnace which warmed the whole 
house, a bright coal fire enlivened this room, and the 
large table, the chairs, a mahogany buffet and two easy 
chairs, all indicatetl a love of comfort. They scarcely 
ever entered the reception room ; this was the living 
room of the family. 

Just then M. Grégoire, becomingly dressed in a red 
fustian jacket, entered. He was sixty years of age, 
with large, honest features, and his curling snowy 
locks gave him a patriarchal look. He had seen the 
coachman and gardener; no greater damage had been 
done by the storm than the falling of a chimney. Each 
morning he loved to look over Piolaine, which was not 
large enough to cause much care, but from which he 
derived the happiness of a landlord. 

"Where is Cecil?" he asked, ''is she not going to get 
up to-day?" 

"I do not know," answered his wife. "I think I 
heard her stirring, though." 

The table, covered with a white cloth, had been laid 
for three. 

Honorine was sent to see what had become of Made- 
moiselle. She returned immediately covered with smiles, 
and said on entering the room: 

"Oh! if Monsieur and Madame could see Mademoi- 
selle! . . . She sleeps like an angel. It is a pleas- 
ure to look at her." 

The father and mother exchanged tender glances. 

" Let us go up and see her," said he, with a smile. 

"Ah! the poor darling!" murmured she, "I will go." 

Together they went up stairs. The chamber whither 
they went was the only real luxury of the house; it w^as 



GEEMIXAL. 69 

hung with bhie silk and prorided with lacquer furniture, 
white with threads of blue, to please the whim of tlie 
spoiled child. In the fresh whiteness of the bed, under 
light falling from the window, the curtain of which was 
pushed aside, the young girl la}' sleeping, with her cheek 
resting upon her bare arm. She was not pretty, but 
sound and healthy. Mature, though only eighteen, she 
had a superb skin and delicious freshness; her hair was 
auburn, and her face round, with a small, unbecoming 
nose. Her breath came and went so softly, there was 
no perceptible movement of the chest. 

''That abominable wind must have prevented her from 
sleeping," whispered the mother. 

The father, with a gesture, silenced her. Both stood, 
tenderly bending over and regarding her with admira- 
tion, as she lay there in her virgin purity; this girl, 
whom they had so long desired, given to them so late in 
life. They thought her perfect, as she still slept on, 
without feeling their presence. Then a shadow passed 
slowly over her immobile face, and, trembling lest she 
should awake, they crept silently from the room. 

"Hush!" said the father at the door; "let her have 
her nap out." 

"Certainly," said the mother; "we can wait," 

Returning to the dining room, they installed them- 
selves in their armchairs, while the servants, still smil- 
ing at Mademoiselle's long sleep, without a murmur 
kept the breakfast warm. He took a paper and Madame 
commenced knitting on a woolen foot blanket. It was 
very warm, and not a sound was heard. 

Gregoirc's fortune, almost forty thousand francs a 
year, was all in stocks of the Montson mines. They 
spoke of it with complaisance as commencing with the 
creation of the company. 

At the beginning of the last century a company was 
formed for exploration for coal between Lille and 
Valenciennes. The first success of the patentees, which 
later on formed the company d'Anzin, encouraged 
every one. The ground was sounded in each commune; 
companies were established and grants were made out at 
once. In spite of the stupidity of that age. Baron 
Desrumaux had left behind him the memory of a great 
mind. For four years he had struggled on without 



70 GERMINAL. 

faltering, in the midst of continual obstacles. The 
first explorations were fruitless; new mines were aban- 
doned after long months of work; there Avere cavings 
and sudden inundations, destroying the workmen; hun- 
dreds of thousands of francs were sunk; then there M'as 
government interference, the panics of the stockhold- 
ers, and a contest with land owners resolved not to 
recognize the royal grants, if they refused to treat with 
them first. At last the company, Desrumaux, Fanque- 
noix &amp; Co., was formed to explore tlie Montson grant, 
and the first mines had commenced to give some slight 
returns, when two neighboring companies, Cougny, be- 
longing to Count Cougny, and Joiselle, belonging to the 
company of Cornille &amp; Jenard, went under. The '^Sd 
of August, 1760, these three companies were consoli- 
dated and the company of the Montson mines, now ex- 
isting, was created. The assessments they apportioned 
in accordance with the standard of the money of the 
time. 

In those days the Baron owned Piolaine, and he had 
in his employ a clerk named Honore Grégoire, a boy 
from Ardennes, the great-grandfather of Leon, father 
of Cécile. At the time of the treaty of Montson, Hon- 
ore, who had hoarded, in a stocking, a hundred thou- 
sand francs, tremblingly yielded them to his employer. 
With six thousand livres he took some shares in the 
mine, though fearing to rob his children of that sum. 
His son, Eugene, received very small dividends, and, 
when he had foolishly squandered the other four thou- 
sand francs of his paternal inheritance, became very 
penurious. But, little by little the interest increased. 
Fortune commenced with Félicien, who was able to 
realize the dream with which his grandfather, the old 
secretary, had rocked the cradle of his infancy, the 
purchase of Piolaine, for a paltry sum. Then followed 
years of reverses, the clouds breaking somewhat after 
the revolution, then lowering after the unfortunate 
downfall of Napoleon. It was Leon Grégoire who 
realized from the timid and uncertain investment of his 
grandfather, whose ten thousand francs multiplied with 
the rising prosperity of the conpany. In 1820, they 
yielded cent per cent, ten thousand franc\ In 1844, 
twenty thousand. In 1850, forty. Then there were 



GERMIKAL. 71 

two years that the dividend went up to the enormous 
sum of fifty thousand francs; the value of the stock had 
increased a hundred fold in a hundred and some 
years. 

M. Grégoire, whom they advised to see when the 
stock Avent up so high, smilingly refused. Six months 
later an industrial crisis broke out and the dividends 
again fell to six thousand francs. But he still smiled, 
regretting nothing, for the Gregoires now had an obsti- 
nate faith in their mine. It would go up. God was 
good. A religious conviction was blended with a pro- 
found gratitude for an investment which, for a hundred 
years, had nourished them in idleness. It was well; 
their egotism lulled them into fancied security, while 
they fattened themselves at their well- filled table. This 
had continued from father to son; why venture to dis- 
please fate by doubting? And at length a superstitious 
belief possessed them that, if they converted their stock 
into money it would be lost. They preferred it deep 
down in the earth, where a compauy of miners, genera- 
tion after generation dying of hunger, dug out a little 
each day, according to their wants. 

Happiness was showered on that house. While 
young, M. Grégoire had married the daughter of a 
Marchiennes druggist, a homely girl, without a cent, 
Avhom he adored and who in return made him a good 
wife. She remained at home, happy with her husband, 
having no other will but his; a similarity of tastes 
united them; a single thought of comfort was theirs; 
and they had lived thus without care for forty years. It 
was an even life; the thirty thousand francs were quietly 
expended. But the late birth of Cécile ended their 
economy. All her caprices were gratified; a second 
horse, two more carriages, even toilets sent from Paris. 
She added to their joy and they could not find anything 
too beautiful for her, though they themselves, with a 
horror of finery, had retained the costumes of their 
youth. All unprofitable expense seemed foolish for 
them. 

Suddenly, the door opened, and a strong voice cried: 

"Weill what is this, have you breakfasted without 
me?" 

It was Cécile, just up, her eyes still swollen with 



73 GERMINAL. 

sleep. She had simply combed her hair and slipped on 
a white woolen wraj^per. 

"No," said her mother, "you see we have been waiting 
for you . . . Well! that wind must have prevented 
you from sleeping, poor darling." 

The young girl looked at them in surprise. 

"Has it been blowing? ... I knew nothing of 
it; I have not stirred all night." 

This seemed so strange that they all laughed; even 
the servants, who were bringing in the breakfast, smiled 
at the idea of Mademoiselle's having slept so soundly for 
twelve hours. 

"Ah! that is nice," said Cécile as she saw the milk 
bread. " That will be good in our chocolate." 

They seated themselves at the table; the chocolate 
was smoking in the cups, and for a time, nothing was 
spoken of but the bread. Melanie and Honorine re- 
mained watching them devour it, saying, it was a pleas- 
ure to make anything when it was eaten with such 
enjoyment. 

But the dogs began to bark violently; they thought it 
was the music teacher who came from Marchiennes on 
Tuesday and Friday. The governess also came, as the 
young girl was receiving her education at home, still 
ignorantly happy, with the caprice of a child throwing 
her book from the window when a question bothered her. 

"It is M. Deneulin," said Honorine, entering the 
room. 

Following her M. Deneulin, a cousin of M. Gre- 
gorie's, entered without ceremony; his loud voice and 
quick movement gave him the appearance of a cavalry 
officer. Although he was over forty, his close cut hair 
and large mustache were as black as ink. 

" Yes, it is I; good-morning. Do not disturb your- 
selves." 

He seated himself, while the family returned his 
greeting. Finally, they consented to finish their choc- 
olate. 

" Have you anything particular to say to me?" asked 
M. Grégoire. 

"No, nothing at all," Deneulin hastened to reply. 
" I am out for a horse-back ride and in passing only 
stopped to say good-morning." 



GEEMINAL. 73 

Cécile asked after his daughters, Jeanne and Lucia. 
They were doing well; the first was learning to paint, 
while the other, the elder, cultivated her voice. He 
added that his scape-grace son, Maurice, would soon be- 
come a captain. And his voice trembled slightly with 
an emotion which he-shook off with an effort. 

M. Grégoire resumed: 

'' And does everything go on as you wish, at the 
mines?" 

*'D nit! I am turned topsy-turvy like my com- 
rades by this crisis. . . . We always pay for the 
prosperous years! They have built too many work- 
shops, made too many paved roads, and now the capital 
will not warrant increased expense. Happily, the case 
is not desperate as yet. I shall get out of it all the 
same." 

His history was simple. Like his cousin, he had re- 
ceived, as an inheritance, some stock in the Montson 
mine. But he, incited with an anxiety for wealth, bad 
hastened to sell when the stock had gone up to a mill- 
ion. For some months he had been cherishing a 
scheme. His wife had brought him the little grant of 
Vandame, in which there were only two mines, Jean- 
Bart and Gaston-Marie, both in such an abandoned 
state, and with material so defective, that the yield 
scarcely covered the expense of working. He thought 
of repairing Jean-Bart by renovating the machinery, 
enlarging the shaft and sinking it still deeper; and then 
keep Gaston-Marie only for drainage. The shovel 
would bring them gold, he said. The idea was a cor- 
rect one. Only the million was gone and the industrial 
crisis had broken out at the very moment when every- 
thing was going right. A poor financier and good- 
natured with his workmen, he had allowed himself to 
be plundered ever since the death of his wife, leaving 
the management to his daughters, the elder of whom 
spoke of going on the stage, while the younger had 
already sent two landscapes to the salon, which had 
been refused. Both, however, were good little women, 
smiling even in the midst of their misfortunes. At 
home the threatened poverty had caused tliem to econo- 
mize. 

"You see, Leon," he resumed, his voice faltering, 



74 GERMINAL. 

"you should have sold when I did. Now everything 
is declitiing; you will be ruined. If you had intrusted 
your money to me just see what you would have made 
at Vaudame in our mine." 

M. Grégoire slowly finished his chocolate. Then he 
replied, decidedly: 

" Never! . . . You know very well that I do not 
wish to speculate. I live tranquilly, it would be foolith 
for me to worry my head with the cares of business. 
And, with reference to Montson, it can continue to 
decline; we will still get enough from it. It is not 
necessary to be so grasping. Now listen to me: it is 
you who will bite your fingers some clay, for Montson 
will go up, the grand-children of Cécile will still get 
their bread from it." 

Deneulin listened with an uneasy smile. 

"Then," said he, " if I asked you to put a hundred 
thousand francs in my business, you would refuse?" 

But, seeing the disturbed faces of the Gregoires, he 
regretted having spoken so quickly; he should have put 
off his suggestion of borrowing until later, reserving it 
for a desjierate case. 

"Oh ! I did not mean that, it was a joke. . . . 
Mon Dieu, perhaps you are right. . . . Money 
which you j)roperly gain from others is what makes you 
prosper. " 

Then they spoke of other things. Cécile again talked 
of her cousins, and of the tastes that engrossed their 
attention, but which so displeased her. Mme. Grégoire 
promised to take her daughter to see those little darl- 
ings, the first pleasant day. Meanwhile, M. Grégoire, 
with preoccupied air, took no part in the conversation. 
Suddenly he said in a loud voice : 

"If I were in your place, I would cease this stub- 
bornness. I would negotiate with Monston. 
They will do well again and you will receive your 
money." 

He alluded to the old feud which existed between the 
company of Monston and that of Vandume. In spite 
of the small importance of the latter, her powerful 
neighbor was enraged to see inclosed within her vast 
territoi'y, that square league, which did not belong to 
her; and, after having vainly tried to ruin it, they 



GERMIÎTAL. 75 

plotted to buy it at a low price, when it was about to 
succumb. This contest continued without relaxation; 
each gallery stopped within two hundred metres 
of the other; it was war to the knife, although the di- 
rectors and engineers observed the ordinary rules of 
politeness in their intercourse with each other. 

Deneulin's eyes flashed. 

" Never!" cried he. "As long as I live, Monston shall 
not have Vandame. ... I dined with M. Henne- 
beau on Tliursday and noticed his patronizing manner. 
When the directors were here last autumn, they made 
all sorts of love to me. . . . Yes, yes, I know 
them, these Marquises and Dukes, these Generals and 
Ministers! they are all robbers who would steal the very 
shirt from your back." 

M. Grégoire did not defend the dii'ectors, the six 
administrators appointed by the agreement of 17C0, 
who ruled while despoiling the company, and the sur- 
viving five, of whom, at each death, chose a new mem- 
ber from the wealthy and powerful stock-holders. The 
owner of Piolaine, with his upright impulses, was of 
the opinion that these gentlemen in their exaggerated 
love of money, were sometimes wanting in integrity. 

Melanie had come in to clear away the table. 
Without, the dogs were again barking, and Honorine 
was already directing her steps toward the door, when 
Mademoiselle, overpowered by the heat, left the table. 

''Never mind, that must be for my lesson." 

Deneulin, also arose ; watching the young girl leaving 
the room, he asked, with a smile : 

" Well! and what of that marriage with little Megrel? " 

" Nothing is settled," said Mme. Grégoire. ''It is 
merely an idea, which it is necessary to consider." 

" Yes, yes," continued he with a merry laugh. . . . 
"I am astonished that ]\Ime. Hennebeau wishes it, after 
the talk one hears." 

But M. Grégoire became indignant : So distin- 
guished a woman, much older than the young man : 
It was absurd. He did not like to hear people joke 
upon such subjects. Deneulin, still laughing, shook 
hands and left. 

" It is not my teacher," said Cécile. " It is that woman 
with her two children, you know, mamma, the one we 



76 GERMINAL. 

met the other day. . . . Can they come in 
here?" 

They hesitated. Were they very dirty? No, not 
very, and they could leave their shoes outside. The 
fatlier and mother were already stretched out in their 
arm chairs ; the thought of moving decided them. 

"Let them enter, Honorine. Maheu's wife and the 
two little ones came in, nearly frozen and half-starved, 
and trembling with fear on finding themselves in that 
comfortable room, where the odor of breakfast still re- 
mained. 



CHAPTER VIII. 



I]sr a darkened room, through the closed blinds, little 
by little, appeared the faint gray streaks of dawn, 
spreading themselves to the ceiling, but in a close 
atmosphere all continued their slumbers; Lenore and 
Henri in each other's arms, Alzire lying on her hump 
back, with head thrown backward, while old Bonnemort, 
with mouth open and snoring loudly, occupied alone 
the bed belonging to Jeanlin and Zacharie. Not a 
breath came from the little room where the mother had 
fallen asleep while nursing Estelle. 

The wooden clock down stairs struck six; along the 
alley was heard the sound of closing doors, and the 
click-clack of wooden shoes on the sidewalk. It was 
the screeners going to the mine. Until seven o'clock 
all was again silent. Then shutters were thrown back, 
and through the wall came the sound of yawning and 
coughing. Now the grinding of coffee was heard; yet 
no one av/oke in that room. 

But, suddenly, the noise of slaps and barking aroused 
Alzire. Knowing what time it was, she ran barefooted 
to shake her mother. 

"Mother! mother! get up, it's late. You know you 
have to go out. Take care, you'll mash Estelle." 

And she pulled the child out from beneath its 
mother. 

"Sakes alive !" stammered the woman, rubbing her 
eyes, " I'm so tired, I could sleep all day. 
Dress Lenore and Henri, I'll take them with me; you 



GEKMIN-AL. 77 

can mind Estelle, I don't want to drag her along, she'll 
catch cold in this weather." 

She hastily washed herself and put on an old bine 
skirt, her best one, and a gray woolen Jacket, on which 
she had sewn two patches the day before. 

"What shall I do?" murmured she. ''The little 
ones must have something to eat." 

As her mother descended the stairs, Alzire re-entered 
the room, taking with her Estelle, who was crying. 
But she was accustomed to the rage of the little one; 
and though only eight years old, she calmed and amused 
her with the tender air of a little woman. Placing her 
in her still warm bed, she coaxed her to sleep again. 
Now another uproar arose, and she was obliged to 
make peace between Lenore and Henri who had at last 
awakened. These children only agreed when asleep. 
The girl of six years, on awakening, flew at the boy of 
two, who could not defend himself. Both had large 
heads, covered with yellow hair. Alzire pulled her 
sister out of the bed. Then they stamped while she 
washed them, and put on each article of clothing. 
They did not open the shutters for fear of arousing 
old Bonnemort, who continued to snore amid the con- 
fusion. 

" Come on down, if you're ready," cried the mother. 

Then she opened the shutters, raked the fire and put 
on some coal. A glance into the empty sauce pan dis- 
pelled the hope that the old man had left a little soup. 
She cooked a little handful of vermicelli which had been 
held in reserve for three days. The cupboard was 
empty; not a crust, not even a bone remained there. 
Wliat would become of them if Maigrat stopped their 
credit and the rich people at Piolaine would not give her 
a hundred sous? When the men and girl returned 
from the mine there must be something for them to eat. 
They could not live without food. 

" Come down, right away," she cried again, "I must 
be off." 

When Alzire and the two children were there, she 
portioned the vermicelli out into three little plates, say- 
ing, she did not wish any. Although Catherine had 
already used the coffee grounds, left from the day before, 
a second time, she poured some water over them and 



78 GERMINAL. 

drank two great bowls of coffee so weak that it looked 
like water with a little iron rust. It was good all the 
same. It would strengthen her, 

"Listen," said she to Alzire, "you must let your 
grandfather sleep, and see that Estelle does not break 
her neck ; if she wakes up and cries too much, here's 
a lump of sugar you can melt and give her in spoon- 
fuls. . . . I know your'e too sensible to eat it your- 
self." 

"How about school, mamma?" 

" That'll have to wait another day. I need you now." 

"And the soup, don't you want me to make it if 
you're late?" 

"Ko, you'll have to wait 'till I get home." 

Alzire, with the precocious intelligence of an invalid, 
knew how to make soup. But she did not insist, she 
understood why she must wait. Now the whole alley 
was astir ; troops of children were going off to school 
with loitering step. Eight o'clock struck ; the sound 
of voices arose at the house of Levaque, on the left. 

The wives' day had begun, which would be spent 
in going from house to house, their hands on their 
hips, their tongues running without a break. 

At that moment a wan face, with large lips and a 
broken nose, M'as flattened against the window pane, 
while a woman cried : 

"Listen! I've something new to tell you." 

"No, not now," replied Maheu's wife. "I'm in a 
hurry." 

And, refusing the offer of a cup of warm coffee, she 
set out, pushing Lenore and Henri before her. From 
the room above, Bonnemort's regular snore filled the 
house. 

Outside, the mother was surprised to find it was no 
longer blowing. The sky was heavy, and a chilly thaw 
was dampening the walls and filling the roads with the 
mud peculiar to coal regions, black as soot, thick and 
clinging. Boxing Lenore's ears for heaping the mud 
on the toes of her shoes as upon the end of a shovel, 
she left the alley, passed along the canal-road, and then, 
to shorten the distance, cut through fields inclosed by 
moss-covered fences. Manufactories succeeded each 
other, with high chimneys, denoting a country of in- 



GERMINAL. 79 

dustry. Behind a group of poplars was the old mine 
Eequillart, of whicli the c^rpeuter-work of the tower 
aloue remained standing. ISlovv, turning to the right, 
the woman came out upon the main road. 

"Stop! stop! dirty pigs!" cried she. '-ril make 
mud balls for you." 

This tmie, Henri had gathered up a handful of mud 
and was rolling it into a ball. The two children, after 
being slapped, returned to their mother's side, laughing 
at the imprint of their hands in tlie middle of the road. 
They were already covered with dirt, and exhausted 
with their efforts to plod through that sticky mud. 

On one side of Marchinnes, was two leagues of straight 
road, while the other side wound down into Monston, 
built upon a slope of the plain. 'J'hese roads of the 
north, laid out by rule and line, between manufactur- 
ing villages, were well made; little by little, buildings 
were going up, tending to make of this part of the 
country only working towns. The small brick houses, 
to prevent sameness, were painted, some yellow, some 
blue, and others black, while a serpentine line of black 
ran across the village from right to left as far as the 
end of the hill. There were two low pavilions and 
houses belonging to manufacturing officials. The 
church, also of brick, resembled a new kind of furnace, 
with its square steeple, already dirty from the flying 
coal dust. And among the sugar-mills, ware-houses 
and wheel-shops, the dance-halls, smoking-rooms and 
saloons were so numerous that, of the thousand houses, 
five hundred sold liquor. 

As she approached the ware-houses and shops belong- 
ing to the company, the mother decided to take the 
hands of Henri and Lenore. Before them was the 
house of M. Hennebeau, an enormous building which 
was separated from the road by a railing and garden, 
in which a few trees were reluctantly growing. A car- 
riage had stopped before the door, from which a gentle- 
man and lady were alighting, visitors arriving from 
Paris, for Madame Hennebeau, who appeared in the 
vestibule, gave an exclamation of surprise and joy. 

" Come on now," muttered the mother, pulling the 
children out of the mud. 

Very uneasy, she arrived at Maigrat's house, which 



80 GERMIKAL. 

was next to the director's, a simple wall separating 
them. The store in front contained ever}- saleable ar- 
ticle, meat, fruit, bread, beer, crockery and notions. 
A former overseer of the Voreux — lie had started out in 
a small way ; then, thanks to the protection of the 
chiefs, his business had enlarged little by little, driving 
out all other sho^js in Montson. Having monopolized 
trade, he was able to sell cheaper and give credit. But 
he still remained in the hands of the company, which 
had built for him his little house and store. 

"Here I am again. Monsieur Maigrat," humbly said 
the woman, finding him standing before his door. 

He eyed her without a word. Fat, cold and jjolite, 
he prided himself on never changing his mind. 

" You won't turn me away like you did 3'esterday, will 
you? We must have bread to eat until Monday. I know 
we've owed you sixty francs for two years." 

She spoke in short, faltering sentences. It was an 
old debt, contracted during a strike. Twenty times 
they had promised to pay up, but were unable to do so ; 
last pay day they had given him forty sous ; then, a 
shoemaker whom they owed twenty francs threatened . 
to have them arrested, and they were obliged to pay him 
all the money they had left. That was the reason they 
were now without a sou. At other times, like their 
comrades, their money held out until more was re- 
ceived. 

Without opening his mouth and with arms crossed 
over his stomach, Maigrat shook his head at eacli sup- 
plication. 

'^Nothing, but two loaves of bread, Monsieur Mai- 
grat. I'm reasonable, I don't ask for coffee. . . . 
Onlv two three-pound loaves a day." 

"'Is^o!" he thundered at last. 

His wife came forward, a wretched creature, who 
passed her days over a register without even daring to 
raise her head ; but she moved away in fright on seeing 
the unhappy woman turn her beseeching eyes toward 
her. They said she yielded her conjugal relations to 
the girls of the town. It was a known fact, that when 
a miner wished a prolongation of credit, by sending 
his wife or daughter, whether pretty or ugly, if they 
were compliant, it was obtained. 



GERMINAL. 81 

Sick at heart and followed by the cold looks of Mai- 
grat, the mother turned away, pushing her children 
before her. 

" This won't bring you luck, Monsieur Maigrat, re- 
member that!" 

Only one hope remained ; the rich people at Piolaine. 
If they would not give her a hundred sous, they must 
all lie down and die. Turning to the left she took the 
Joiselle road, in an angle of which was the director's 
house, a veritable brick palace, to which a number of 
the great men of Paris, princes and persons of au- 
thority, came each autumn to enjoy great dinners. 
Walking on, she planned how she would spend the 
hundred sous ; first, some bread, then coiïee, potatoes, 
a quart of beer, and, perhaps, a little hogshead of cheese 
for the men who needed meat. 

The Montson priest, the Abbé Joire, passed her, pick- 
ing his way through the mud like a well-kept cat who 
was afraid of soiling itself. He was a good man, who 
lived at peace with all the world. 

" Good-morning, Monsieur le Curé." 

He smiled at the children and passed on, leaving her 
standing in the middle of the road She was not relig- 
ious, but the thought had come to her that the priest 
might give her something. 

The journey through the black and sticky mud was 
resumed. Tliere were still two kilometres to drag the 
now worn-out children. At each side of the road were 
the same moss-covered fences, inclosing manufactories 
discolored with smoke. Then came the open fields, 
large and flat, like an ocean of brown turf. Not a tree 
was visible, but a purpling line denoted the forest of 
Vandame. 

"Carry me, mamma." 

And tucking up her dress, with a desire to arrive as 
neat as possible, she carried them by turns. Twice she 
nearly fell in the soft road. When they had at last 
reached the doorstep, three large dogs jumped upon 
them, barking so loud that the little ones screamed with 
fear, as the coachman whipped them off. 

" Leave your shoes and come in," said Honorine. 

In the dining-room the mother and children stood 
motionless, overcome by the sudden heat, and uneasy

under the glances of the old gentleman and lady who 
were stretched out in the arm-chairs. 

" You must attend to them, my daughter/' said the 
latter. 

The Gregoires charged Cécile with their alms-giving. 
That entered into their idea of a good education. It 
was necessary to be charitable, they said. But they 
flattereà themselves that they dealt out charity with in- 
telligence, having a continual fear of being mistaken 
and encouraging vice. Go, they never gave money, not 
ten sous, not even two; for it was well known that as 
soon as a beggar had two sous, he spent them for drink. 
Therefore, their charity especially consisted in the dis- 
tribution of warm, winter clothing, to the poor children. 

"Oh! the poor darlings!" said Cécile, " they are pale 
from the cold! . . . Honorine, go up stairs and 
get the bundle." 

The maids were also eyeing these miserable people 
with the pity and feeling of girls never in want of a 
meal. While the chamber-maid went up stairs, the 
cook, forgetting herself, set the milk-bread back upon 
the table and stood looking on with folded arms. 

"I still have two good woolen dresses and some little 
capes," said Mademoiselle. " The poor little things 
shall be warm." 

Then Maheu's wife found her tongue, stammering: 

" Thank you. Mademoiselle. . . . You're very 
good." 

Her eyes filled with tears; she was snre of a hundred 
sous, she only occupied herself in studying how to ask 
for them, if they were not offered. The chamber-maid 
not returning, a moment of embarrassed silence fol- 
lowed. On each side of their mother, holding tight to 
her skirts, the little ones fixedly regarded the milk- 
bread. 

" Have you only those two?" asked Madame Grégoire, 
to break the silence, 

" Oh! Madame, I've seven." 

M. Grégoire, who had resumed his paper, gave an 
indignant start. 

" Seven children, good heavens!" 

"It is imprudent," murmured the old lady. 

The mother excused herself with an uneasy gesture. 



CtErmikal. 83 

At their bouse they never would have been able to live 
if two of the boys and the eldest girl had not been old 
enough to go into the mine. For it was necessary to 
feed the children, though they earned nothing. 

'MIavô you worked in the mine fora long time?" 
asked Madame Grégoire. 

The woman smiled. 

"Ah! yes, I worked there until I was married. But 
my husband's people have been below for centuries. 
They struck the first blows of the pick at Requillart." 

Again M. Grégoire dropped his paper and glanced at 
the woman and those children with waxen skins, faded 
hair and pinched features, slowly dying of hunger. 
Silence fell again. Xo sound was heard save the crack- 
ing coal, which threw out a jet of gas. The warm room 
had that air of comfort only found in the apartments of 
the rich. 

"What is the matter with her," cried Cécile impa- 
tiently. " Melanie, go and tell her that the bundle is in 
the bottom of the armoire, on the left." 

Meanwhile, M. Grégoire finished aloud the reflections 
with which these famished people had inspired him 

"It is very true, there is some bad in this world ; but, 
my good woman I cannot help saying the workmen are 
not always wise. . . . Instead of putting a few 
sous aside, like the peasants, the miners driuk, run into 
debt and end by not having enough to feed their chil- 
dren." 

" Monsieur is "right," replied the woman sedately. 
" They're not always sensible. That's what I say to them 
when they complain. . . . I'm much behind, 
though my husband drinks but little. On wedding 
days he sometimes takes too much, but it always ends 
there. So that don't hold good with us, you see, for 
before he was married he drank all the time. And 
yet there are days like to-day, when you turn your 
pockets inside out, without finding a sou." 

She was thinking of the hundred sou pieces, and her 
voice at first low and timid, became loud and eager, as 
she explained that fatal debt. They had paid regularly 
for some months ; but one day, they got behind, then 
all was ended, for they could not catch up again. The 
hole grew larger, and the men were disheartened with 



84 GERMINAL. 

the work which did not pay them enough to keep 
straight. They could not get out of tliis scrape. But 
they must understand the whole affair. A shoemaker 
in want of a drink to wash down the dust, had begun 
their trouble. Perhaps it was no fault of his. Atany- 
rate the workmen did not earn enough. 

"The company gives you fuel and houses, I believe," 
said Madame Grégoire. 

With a glance at the coal flaming in the fire-place 
she answered: 

"Yes, they give us coal. It's not very good, but it 
burns. . . . The rent's only six francs; that don't 
seem like much to you, but sometimes its pretty hard 
to pay it. Why, to-day, if they were to cut me to 
pieces I couldn't hand them a sou, for you can't give 
what you haven't got." 

The gentleman and lady were silent and yawned a 
little languidly, depressed and uncomfortable by the 
exposure of this misery. She fearing she had offended 
them, added with a wise and calm air of a practical 
woman: 

" It does no good to complain. Things are so and 
we'll have to stand them. No matter how much we 
tried, we couldn't change anything. So, Monsieur and 
Madame, it's best to be honest and work on with the 
strength the good God has given us, isn't it?" 

M. Grégoire nodded his head approvingly: 

" With such sentiments, my good woman, one is 
above misfortune." 

Honorine and Melanie brought in the bundle. Cécile 
opened it and took out two little dresses and capes, also 
some stockings and mittens. Those would do very 
well, and with the maid's assistance, she hastily tied up 
the bundle, for her piano teacher had arrived at last, 
and she pushed the mother and children towards the 
door. 

"We are so short," stammered the woman. "If 
you've only a hundred-sou piece." 

The words choked her, for the Maheus were proud 
and would not beg. Cécile uneasily glanced at her 
father, but he slowly refused with an air of duty. 

"No, it is not our habit. We caunot." 

Then the young girl turned to her mother, wishing 



GERMIIîî'AL. 85 

to give something to the children. They were still 
looking at the milk-bread, and cutting it in two she 
gave it to them. 

" Here! this is for you.^' 

Then she took it back and asked for an old paper. 

*' Wait, you can share with your brothers and sisters.^^ 

And, under the watchful glances of her parents, she 
ended by pushing them outside. The poor, hungry 
little things went off holding the bread carefully, their 
little hands benumbed with tlie cold. 

Pulling her children along the road, the mother no 
longer noticed the barren fields, the black mud, or the 
livid sky. When she arrived at Montson, she resolutely 
entered Maigrat's store, begging so piteously that she 
ended by carrying away two loaves of bread, other pro- 
visions, and even a hundred-sou piece, v/hich was lent 
her for a week. When he told her to send her daughter 
to get the provisions she understood his kindness. But 
she did not fear; Catherine was a good girl, and, for 
any insult, would slap his face. 



CHAPTER IX. 



It was eleven by the clock of the little church on the 
narrow street of the Deux- Cent-Quarante, a brick 
chapel, where the Abbé Joire said mass on Sunday. 
On one side, through the closed windows of the school- 
house, also of brick, came the sound of children's voices. 
The wide roads, separated by little gardens, back to 
back and four great rows of uniform houses, were de- 
serted, and these gardens, ravaged by winter, were still 
strewn with the remains of their last vegetables. The 
smoking chimneys denoted preparation for dinner; at 
intervals, along the alley a woman opened the door and 
after a hasty glance again disappeared. There was a 
constant dripping from the waste pipes into casks. 
Although it was not raining, the gray atmosphere was 
filled with moisture. This village, built in the midst 
of vast fields surrounded by black roads as with a band 
of mourning, had nothing to relieve its sornbreness, but 
those regular rows of red tiles, constantly washed by 
the storms. 



86 GERMINAL. 

La Maheude went to buy a few potatoes from the 
wife of an overseer, who still had some left from her 
crop. Behind a clump of poplars, the only trees of 
that part of the country, stood a group of isolated 
dwellings in rows of four, surrounded by gardens. 
When the company had reserved those houses for the 
overseers, the workmen had named that corner of the 
town the Bas-de-Joie ; just as they had ironically 
called their alley — Paie-tes-Dettes. 

" Here we are,'' said the mother, as, loaded with 
bundles, she pushed Lcnore and Henri into the house. 

Alzire was sitting before the fire, rocking in her arms 
the screaming Estelle, to whom she had given all the 
sugar without being able to quiet her. 

" Give her to me," said the mother, as soon as she had 
thrown her bundles on the table. "■ She won't let us 
say a word." 

The child began nursing, and they could at last hear 
themselves talk. All had gone well in her absence, the 
little economist had kept the fire up, swept and dusted 
the room, and in the silence, they heard the grand- 
father snoring the same rhythmical snore which he had 
not stopped for an instant. 

"Here's some things," murmured Alzire, smiling at 
the provisions. *' Shall I make the soup, mamma?" 

The table was covered: a bundle of clothing, two 
loaves of bread, some potatoes, butter, cofiee, chicory 
and half a pound of hogs-head cheese. 

''Oh ! the soup !" said the mother, with a weary air, 
''some sorrel must be picked and the leeks gathered 
first. . . . No, you can make that after a while for 
the men. . . . Put some potatoes to boil; we'll eat 
them with a little butter. . . . And don't forget to 
make some coffee." 

Suddenly she thought of the milk-bread, and looked 
at the empty hands of Lenore and Henri, who had 
thrown themselves on the floor, already rested and hap- 
py. On the road these gourmands had slyly eaten it. 
She boxed their ears, while Alzire, who was putting the 
sauce-pans on the fire, tried to appease her. 

"Leave them alone, mamma. If it was for me, you 
know I'm just as well off. They were hungry from 
walkin&lt;r so far." 



GEKMIXAL. 87 

Noon sounded; the children were heard returning 
from school. The potatoes were cooked and the coffee, 
one-half chicory, was passed through the filterer. A 
corner of the table was cleared; but the mother alone 
ate there; the children contented themselves with their 
laps; and the littl&amp;boy, still hungry, without saying a 
word, constantly turned towards the hogs-head cheese, 
the greasy paper of which annoyed him exceedingly. 

The mother was drinking her coffee in little swallows, 
warming her hands by holding them around the cup, 
when old Bonnemort came down. Usually, he arose 
later, and found his breakfast waiting for him on the 
fire. This morning he growled because there was no 
soup, but when his daughter-in-law told him people did 
not always get what they wished, he ate his potatoes in 
silence. From time to time he arose to spit in the fire; 
and no longer having teeth, he rolled the food in his 
mouth a long time, his head bent over, his eyes dull. 

"Oh! I forgot, mamma," said Alzire, "our neigh- 
bor's been here. ..." 

Her mother interrupted her. 

"She bothers me." 

She was angry at Levaque's wife, who, the day be- 
fore, had refused to lend her a few sous, although her 
lodger had just paid her a week's board in advance. 
The neighbors in that alley, would lend very little to 
each other. 

" That puts me in mind," said the mother. I bor- 
rowed some coffee from Pierron's wife, day before yes- 
terday. Wrap me up a mill-full and I'll carry it back 
to her." 

When the child had prepared the package, saying she 
would return immediately to make soup for the men, 
she went out with Estelle in her arms, leaving old Bon- 
nemort slowly eating his j^otatoes, while Lenore and 
Henri were fighting over the falling skins. 

Fearing, if she appeared in the street, la Levaque 
would call her, she went across the gardens, passing 
through a hole in the old fence, which separated them. 
A well was there which was used by four families. 
Behind it was a coop, now full of old tools, in which 
they raised the rabbits, eaten on fete days. One o'clock 
struck. Not a soul was to be seen at the doors and 



88 GERMIXAL. 

windows; one man, waiting for the time to go to work, 
was digging in his garden, without even raising his head 
as she passed. Suddenly the woman was surprised to 
see a gentleman and two ladies coming around the 
church corner. After a second look, she recognized 
them. It was M. Hennebeau, who was showing the 
alle}^ to the guests who had arrived that morning. 

"Oh! why have you taken that trouble!" said la 
Pierronne, on seeing the coffee. "I was in no hurry 
for it." 

She was twenty-eight years of age and the handsomest 
woman in the alley, with a bright face, a low forehead, 
large eyes and a little coquettish mouth. A white cat 
was no cleaner than she, and never having had a child, 
her form was still perfect. Her mother, the Brule, 
widow of a digger who died at the mine, sent her 
daughter to work in a store, swearing she would never 
marry a miner; and when, later on, the girl became 
the wife of Pierron, a widower with a child of eight 
years, she had nearly died with rage. For two years 
they lived very happily, without a debt, meat twice a 
week and a house so cleanly kept that they could see 
themselves in the sauce-pans. The company had al- 
lowed her to sell cakes and candies, the jars of which 
were arranged upon shelves along the window. It was 
a gain of six or seven sous a day, and on Sundays, 
sometimes twelve. Yet, in the midst of that good 
fortune, the Brule stormed with rage and little Lydie 
received, in too frequent blows, the outbursts of her 
temper. 

" How big she's growing, '^ said Pierre n's wife smiling 
at Estelle. 

"Don't speak of it," replied the mother. "Ill 
weeds always grow fast. You're lucky not to have any. 
You can keep yourself clean." 

And she threw an envious glance at this room where 
everything was in order, so neat as to be almost dainty, 
with roses upon the buffet, a mirror and three framed 
engravings. 

Meanwhile this neat little housekeeper had been 
preparing to drink her coffee alone, as all her family 
were at that hour in the mine. 

" You'll drink a cup with me, won't you?" said she. 



GERM IX AL. 89 

"No, thanks, I ^as just starting to drink my own." 

"What difference does that make?" 

Then she accepted. And standing before the window 
they looked, between the bars, at the houses across the 
street, the little curtains of which betokened the clean- 
liness of the house-wives. 

Levaque's, of real torchon, looked as though they had 
been used to wipe the pots and kettles. 

" How is it possible to live in such dirt?" murmured 
la Pierronne. 

Then her visitor burst out : "Ah! if 1 had a lodger 
like that Bouteloup, I'd get along well! When one is 
smart, a lodger is an excellent thing. But, they said 
that woman's husband drank, beat her and ran after the 
singing girls in the cafés at Montson." 

La Pierronne shrugged her shoulders with an air of 
profound disgust. " Those horrible women. But what 
astonishes me is that you allow your son to go with 
their daughter. How's one going to help it? Their 
garden is next to ours. Why, last summer Zacharie 
and Philoméne were always courting behind the lilacs ; 
we couldn't go to the well for water without surprising 
them." 

It was a simple tale of the promiscuousness of that 
alley, where parents only became angry when their sons 
were in haste to marry their mistresses, as a married 
child was no longer a help to them, they said. " You'd 
better put a stop to it," said la Pierronne, "they've 
two children now, and they're bound to be married 
soon. His money will be a great loss to you." 

The mother in a fury, threw out her hands. " Listen 
to this: I'll curse them if they do. . . . Don't 
Zacharie owe me some respect ? He's cost us enough, 
hasn't he ? Well, he's got to pay us back before he 
takes a wife. What would become of us if our children 
left us as soon as they grew up to work for others ? 
Why, we'd all starve." 

Then she became calm again. 

" Well, we'll see how it ends. Your coffee is very 
good ; it's strong." 

And after a quarter of an hour spent in talk- 
ing of her neighbors, she went off in haste, saying 
her soup was not made. The children were returning 



90 GERMINAL. 

from school. N"ow and then a woman appeared at the 
door, watching Mme. Henuebeau, wlio was going from 
one alley to another. That visit was creating a stir in 
tlie neighborhood. Two frightened hens vv^ere driven 
off in a garden, while the man at work there paused 
to watch the strangers. 

When la Maheu arrived before Levaque's house, she 
ran against the wife who had started out to stop 
Doctor Vanderhaghen, the company's physician. He 
was a little man, always in a hurry, so overwhelmed 
with business that he gave advice while walking. 

" Monsieur/' said she, "I can't sleep. I feel sick all 
over. I must talk with you/' 

He responded, without stopping : 

*' Give me some peace? you drink too much coffee." 

"And my husband, Monsieur," said Mahue's wife, 
*'you ought to come and see him. . . . His limbs 
ache all the time." 

" Let hmi take more rest then." 

The woman remained motionless, watching the doc- 
tor's back disappear in the distance. 

" Come in," said la Lavaque, as they finished shrug- 
ging their shoulders. "You must know something 
new. . . , And you'll have a cup of coffee ; it's 
just been made." 

La Maheu struggled to say no, but being weak, she 
consented to go in and have a drop, not to be dis- 
obliging. 

The room was black with filthiness, the ceiling and 
walls were covered with grease, the sideboard and table 
sticky with dirt, while a disagreeable odor pervaded the 
whole house. Beside the fire, with both elbows on the 
table and his nose buried in his plate, Bouteloup, a 
young looking man of thirty-three, with great broad 
shoulders, was finishing his bouilli, while little Achille, 
the firstborn of Philoméne, two years old, watched him 
with pleading eyes. The lodger, very tender hearted, 
in spite of his great fierce-looking beard, from time to 
time drew a piece of meat from his mouth and gave it 
to the child. 

''Wait, I'll sweeten it," said la Maheu, jjutting 
some brown sugar in the coffee. 

Levaque's wife, six years his senior, was terribly hag- 



GERMINAL. 91 

gard, her figure wholly gone; she had a large square 
mouth and gray hair, always uncombed. He was as 
blind to her want of attractions as to the fact that his 
soup was not clean, or the sheets on his bed were not 
changed in six weeks. This all came with cheap board. 

" I wanted to tell you," continued she, "that some 
one saw la Pierronne over at the alley Bas-de-Joie. 
That gentleman — you know who — was waiting for her 
behind Rasseneur's and they went off together along the 
canal. That's a nice thing for a married woman." 

"Why!" said la Maheu, "before Pierron was mar- 
ried, he used to give that overseer rabbits, now I sup- 
pose he thinks it costs him less to let him make love to 
his wife." 

Bouteloup burst out laughing, and threw a piece of 
bread, soaked in gravy, into Achille's mouth. The two 
women continued talking of la Pierronne, a coquette, 
they said, no handsomer than any other woman, who 
was always washing herself and putting on pomades. 
But that was the husband's affair; if he liked it, it was 
all right. There were some men so ambitious that they 
would kiss their chief's feet, only to hear them say 
thanks. Just then a neiglibor came in, bringing the 
younger child of Philoméae, Désirée. This chiltt had 
just finished its breakfast, having been taken down to 
the screeuers, where its mother stopped her work to sit 
down in the coal and nurse it. 

"I can't leave my baby a minute, or she'll scream," 
said la Maheu, looking at Estelle who had fallen 
asleep in her arms. 

But she could not avoid the subject la Levaque was 
about to begin upon. 

" Say now, it's most time to stop this." 

At first the two mothers, without caring to speak of 
it, had agreed not to hasten the marriage. If Zacharie's 
mother wished to keep as long as possible the pay of 
her son, Philoméne's mother also hated to give up her 
daughter's. There was no hurry, the latter even preferred 
to keep the little one, as long as there was only one 
child ; but when it grew large enough to eat, and 
another came, she found that she was losing money and 
became anxious to see her daughter the wife of Zacharie. 



92 GERMINAL 

"There's nothing to stop it now," continued she. 
" Let's see, when sliall it be?" 

"At least, v&gt;'ait till the weather is good," replied la 
Maheu, embarrassed. " I won't say anything agaiust 
it then. I'm tired of this business though. If Cathe- 
rine ever gets herself in a fix like this I'll strangle her. 

Levaque's wife shrugged her shoulders. 

" Get out, she'll do as all the others have done before 
her." 

Bouteloup, with the calm air of a man in his own 
house, went to the sideboard for some bread. On one 
corner of the table were the soup, vegetables, potatoes 
and beets, half peeled, resumed and abandoned six 
times amid continual gossiping. The woman had again 
seated herself before them, when she suddenly arose 
and went to the window. 

"Who's that? Why it's Madame Hennebeau with 
some people. They're going to Pierron's house." 

Then they both again began talking of La Pierronne. 
That was always the way. Whenever any guests of the 
company came there they were always taken straight to 
the house of that woman, because she was clean. Well, 
she could well be neat, with a lover wdio earned three 
thousand francs. If all was pure without, it was not 
the same within. And all the time the visitors re- 
mained, their tongues ran on without stopj^ing. 

" They're going," said la Levaque at last. " They're 
turning round. Look, my dear. I think they're 
coming to your house." 

La Maheu was filled with fear. Who knows 
whether Alzire had cleaned up ; her soup was not ready, 
and she was not dressed. She stammered "good-day" 
and flew off without turning her head. 

But everything shone. Alzire, very sedate and with 
a house-cloth before her, was making the soup, seeing 
her mother did not return. She had pulled the leeks, 
and gathered some sorrel in the garden, and she was 
now cleaning the vegetables, while upon the fire a large 
kettle of water was heating for the men's bath on their 
return. Henri and Lenore were peaceable by chance, 
being very much occupied in tearing up an old almanac. 
The father Bounemort was silently smoking his pipe. 



GERMINAL. 93 

As the mother drew a sigh of relief, Madame Henne- 
beau knocked and entered. 

" You will permit me, will you not ? my good 
woman /^ 

She was a large blonde, a little heavy in the maturity 
of her forty years, aud-she smiled, without showing her 
fear of soiling her toilet, a dark green silk, covered with 
a black velvet mantle. 

" Come in," said she to her guests. "There is noth- 
ing to be feared. . . . Well! is it not clean? This 
good woman has seven children. All our housewives 
are like this. . . . I have explained to you that the 
company rents them the house for six francs a month. 
There is one large room on the first floor, two bed- 
rooms above, a cellar, and a garden." 

The gentleman, who wore the insignia of some order, 
and the lady m a fur cloak, who had that morning ar- 
rived from Paris, opened their eyes in astonishment at 
tiiis life, which was so entirely unknown to them. 

"And a garden," repeated the lady, "why, it's 
charming." 

"We give them more coal than they can burn, con- 
tinued Madame Heunebeau. "A physician visits them 
tv/ice a week, and when they become old, they receive 
pensions, although we do not deduct anything from 
their salaries now." 

" A veritable country of Cocagne," said the gentleman, 
enchanted. 

La Maheu arose hurriedly, offering them chairs. 
The ladies refused. Madame Henneoeau was already 
fatigued. For an instant she forgot her ennui 
in this role she had assumed ; a herd of beasts, she 
thought, and repugnance immediately followed in this 
lieavy atmosphere of misery, although she never made 
herself uneasy by thinking of these people, working 
and suffering beside her. 

"The beautiful children!" murmured the lady, who 
in reality thought them frightful, with their immense 
heads, covered with straw colored hair. 

Out of politeness, they asked their ages and also some 
questions about Estelle. Old Bonneraort had respect- 
fully taken his pipe from his mouth, but he none the 
less remained an object for sympathy, so worn v/as he. 



94 GERMIXAL. 

by his forty years at the bottom, his limbs stiff, his 
frame broken down, his face cadaverous; when a violent 
fit of coughing came upon him, he preferred to go out- 
side to expectorate, fearing that black spittle would 
frighten these people. 

Alzire was a great success. What a sweet little house- 
keeper. They complimented tlie mother on having 
such an intelligent child. No one spoke of her hump, 
although compassionate looks were frequently cast on 
the poor infirm being. 

''Now," concluded Madame Hennebeau, "if they 
speak in Paris of our alleys, you will be able to rej^ly. 
No more rumors like that, for mothers, old people and 
all are happy, as you see. Even we would become in- 
vigorated in this good air and perfect peace." 

"It is marvelous, marvelous!" cried the gentleman, 
in a final burst of enthusiasm. 

They went out, enchanted with this sort of phenome- 
nal hut, and la Maheu stood in the doorway, watch- 
ing them slowly going off talking very loud. The roads 
were full of peojile, and they were compelled to pass 
through groups of Avomen attracted thither by the re- 
port of their visit which had passed from house to house. 

Levaque's wife called to la Pierronne who was run- 
ning past her door. 

" Did you know la Maheu went to Piolaine this 
morning to beg, and that Maigrat, who had refused 
them bread, has given it to them ? That's strange." 

" Oh ! he's after Catherine." 

" She just told me she'd strangle Catherine if she 
did wrong. All I have to say is she'd better watch that 
big Cheval." 

" Hush ! here're the people." Then the two women, 
with a demure air and without impolite curiosity, con- 
tented themselves with looking out of the corners of 
their eyes. As soon as their backs were turned, they 
called la Maheu, who still had Estelle in her arms, 
and these three stood motionless, watching the retreat- 
ing forms of Madame Hennebeau and her guests. When 
they were out of hearing the gossiping was resumed 
with renewed vigor. 

" They've got some noney on their backs. Their 
clothing's worth more them themselves." 



GERMINAL. 95 

*' I don't know anything about tlie otliers, but I 
would'nt give four sous for that one from here, fat as 
slie is. Thev tell some strange stories about her." 

''Well, what are they?" 

**0h ! about men. The engineer is one of them." 

''That little thing?" 

"What difference does that make, if it amuses her? 
I don't think much of a woman who never acts 
as if she was pleased with anything. . . . Look! she 
turns her back on us, as if she despised us all. Is that 
right?" 

Madame Hennebeau and her friends were going on 
with the same loitering step, still talking, when a lan- 
dau drove up before the church, and from it alighted a 
dark gentleman, about forty-eight years of age, with a 
strong face, and his form muffled up in a long, dark 
overcoat. 

" The husband," murmured la Levaque, lowering her 
voice as though he was by her side, filled with the 
strong fear which the director inspired in his ten thou- 
sand workmen. 

Now, everyone in the alley was out-doors. The 
women's curiosity became greater and greater, and the 
groups drew closer together, becoming a perfect mob ; 
while the dirty children lay upon the pavement with 
gaping mouths. The pale face of the school teacher was 
seen an instant peeping from the window. In the gar- 
den, the man who had been digging, rested his foot 
on the spade, while he watched with the others. And 
the murmur of the gossiping voices, swelled out little 
by little with a rustling sound like the wind sweeping 
through a forest of dead leaves. 

The crowd was the thickest before Levaque's door. 
First, two women had approached, then ten and twenty. 
La Pierronne was prudently silent, now that there wore 
so many ears to hear. La Maheu, one of the most 
reasonable women, was also contented to look on. But 
M. Hennebeau had assisted the ladies into the carriage, 
and after seating himself, it drove off on the Mar- 
chiennes road. 

The church clock struck three. Another gang of 
workmen were starting for the mine, old Bonnemort, 
Bouteloup, and others. Suddenly, around the corner 



96 GERMINAL. 

ajipcared the first miners, returning from work, with 
black faces and clothing soaked, their arms folded, and 
shoulders thrown back. They produced a scattering of 
the women ; all ran off, again entering their own doors, 
uneasy housekeepers, whom too much coffee and too 
much gossip had made forgetful of all else. So now 
nothing was heard save this troubled cry : 
" Ah ! Mon Dieu ! my soup is not ready. ^' 



CHAPTER X. 



When" Maheu entered the house, after having left 
Etienne at Easseneur's, he found Catherine, Zacharie 
and Jeanlin at the table, finishing their soup. On 
returning from the mine, they were always so hungry 
that they sat down to eat in their damp clothing 
without even washing their faces ; the table remained 
set from morning until night, and there was constantly 
some one there swallowing his portion, at the risk of 
the exigencies of labor. 

From the door, Maheu perceived the provisions. He 
said nothing, but his anxious face cleared up. All the 
morning, the empty cupboard, the house without coffee, 
or bread, had worried him. A sad thought came to 
him as he worked the vein in his drift: how would the 
v/ife make out? and what would become of them if she 
returned home with empty hands? Here he found 
everything. She would explain it to him later, and, 
while waiting, he smiled contentedly. 

Catherine and Jeanlin had already risen, drinking 
their coffee standing, while Zacharie, his hunger only 
half appeased by his soup, cut for himself a large slice 
of bread, which he covered with butter. He noticed 
the hogs-head cheese which Alzire had put upon a plate, 
but he did not touch it, knowing that when there was 
only enough meat for one, it was intended for his 
father. All washed down their soup with a glass of 
fresh water, the good clear drink which they were 
forced to fall back upon a few days before pay day. 

" There's no beer," said la Maheu, as the father sat 
down to the table. "I wanted to keep a little money. 



GERMINAL. 97 

But if you want it, the little one can run and get a 
pint." 

He looked at her in astonishment. How was that ? 
She had money, too, 

" No, no," said he. " I've just drunk a mug, that's 
enough." And Maheu slowly swallowed a great bowlful 
of soup, made of bread, potatoes, leeks and sorrel. His 
wife, Avith Estelle still in her arms, assisted Alzire in 
waiting on him, handing the butter and meat and 
putting the coffee back on the fire to keep it warm. 

In the meantime, near the cupboard, the bathing had 
commenced in a tub made from the half of a cask. 
Catherine, after emptying the warm water into it, 
tranquilly undressed and with face to the wall and back 
to the fire, rubbed herself vigorously with the soft soap. 
No one paid the slightest attention to her ; when clean, 
she jumped from the tub and ran upstairs, leaving her 
wet clothing in a heap on the floor. A quarrel broke 
out between the two brothers. Jeanlin had hastened to 
get in the tub under the pretense that Zacharie was still 
eating ; and the latter threw him out head over heels, 
claiming his turn, saying, though he was polite enough 
to let Catherine wash first, he didn't want boys' leavings, 
even if the water was black enough to fill "all the ink- 
stands in the neighborhood. They ended by getting in 
the tub together, washing each other's backs ; then, like 
their sister, entirely nude, they disappeared in the 
stairway, 

"What a slop they've made!" said la Maheu, 
taking the clothing from the floor and hanging it to 
dry. " Alzire, wipe up a bit, will you! " 

But a voice on the other side of the wall cut short 
her words. Oaths were heard, mingled with the 
screams of a woman, while now and then heavy blows 
resounded, as though some one was being struck with a 
tin pail. 

" Levaque's beginning again," said Maheu, quietly, 
as he strummed on the bowl with his spoon. " That's 
strange; Bouteloup said the soup was ready." 

" Eeady," said his wife; "I saw the vegetables on the 
table not even peeled." 

The cries grew louder; there was a terrible push 
which shook the wall; then all became silent. The 
7 



98 GERMINAL. 

miner, swallowing a last spoonful, concluded with the 
calm air of justice : 

" She deserved it, if the soup wasn't ready." 

After drinking a glass of water, he cut a square piece 
off of the hogs-head cheese, eating it with some bread. 
No one spoke while the father was eating. He was 
thinking that it did not taste like the meat which came 
from Maigrat's; it must have been bought somewhere 
else; but he did not question his wife, only to ask if the 
old man was still asleep upstairs. No, the grandfather 
had gone out for his accustomed walk, and then silence 
again fell. 

Henri and Lenore, playing in the water which had 
been spilled on the floor, seeing the meat, went and 
stood at their father's knee, watching each piece as it 
was lifted from the plate, their eyes at first full of hope 
which was gradually succeded by a look of consterna- 
tion as it was lost to sight in his mouth. 

" Haven't the children had any?" he inquired. 

And when his wife hesitated lie added: 

''You know I don't like this unfairness. It takes 
away my appetite when they're around me begging like 
this." 

"They've had some," cried she in anger. "If you'd 
listen to them you'd give them your part and the others' 
too; they'd stuff themselves till they burst. Alzire, 
didn't we all have some cheese?" 

" Of course, mamma," replied the little hunch-back, 
who, under these circumstances, lied with the coolness 
of a grown woman. 

Lenore and Henri stood motionless, shocked at these 
lies which they dared not contradict. Their little 
hearts swelled up, and they would have given anything 
to have been able to tell him they had not even tasted it. 

" Go 'way," said their mother, driving them to the 
other side of the room. " You ought to be ashamed 
to hang around your father, as if he was the only one 
who had it. And at any rate, don't he work while you 
others do nothing?" 

But Maheu called thenî, and taking Henri upon his 
left knee and Lenore on his right, he shared the 
remainder with them, cutting it in small pieces which 
the children greedily devoured. 



GERMINAL. 99 

After finishing, he said to his wife: 

"No, don't give me my coffee now. I'm going to 
wash first. You may help me throw out this dirty 
water, though." 

They grasped the handles of the tub, and were 
emptying the water into the gutter before the door, 
when Jeanlin came down, dressed in dry clothes, an 
old faded pair of pants and woolen blouse, much too 
large for him, they having belonged to his brother. As 
he was noiselessly slipping through the open door his 
mother stopped him. 

" Where are you going ?" 

" Xowhere." 

" Nowhere ? You're going to gather dandelions for 
a salad this evening. Now listen, do you hear me ? if 
you don't bring some home, I'll settle with you." 

'' All right." 

And he went out, his hands in his pockets, with the 
gait of an old miner, in spite of his ten years. Zach- 
arie, in a black woolen shirt with blue stripes, descended 
next. His father called after him not to come home 
late, and he went out, nodding his head, without 
replying, and with a pipe between his teeth. 

The tub was again filled with water and, at a glance 
from the mother, Alzire, as was her habit, led the 
children out to play before the door Their father did 
not wash himself before the family, although he con- 
sidered it proper for the children to paddle around 
together. 

"What are you doing up there?" cried la Maheu 
from the bottom of the stairs. 

" I'm mending my dress. I tore it yesterday," re- 
plied Catherine. 

" All right. Don't come down, your father's wash- 
ing," 

La Maheu placed Estelle on a chair, and for a 
wonder, finding herself comfortable in front of a fire, 
the child was quiet, watching her parents with the 
bewildered eyes of a little creature without thought. 
After removing his clothes, he plunged his head into 
the water, rubbing it with that soft soap which had 
discolored and bleached the hair of his race : then 



100 GERMINAL. 

lathering himself all over he stepped into the tub while 
his wife stood by looking on. 

" Say now," she began, "I saw your look when you 
came in. YouM been worrying. Just think, the 
people at Piolaine wouldn't give me a sou. Oh! they 
were very kind, they gave the little ones some clothing, 
and I was ashamed to beg for anything more." 

She paused an instant to tie Estelle in her chair, fear- 
ing she would fall out. The father continued rubbing 
himself, without, by one question, hastening this tale 
which interested him, patiently waiting to be enlight- 
ened. 

" Of course Maigrat refused. He drove me from his 
door like a dog." 

He lifted his head, still watching her in silence. 
Nothing at Piolaine, nothing from Maigrat, who was it 
then? But she began rolling up her sleeves preparatory 
to rubbing his back, and taking up some soft soap she 
lathered his shoulders while he braced himself in order 
to stand the vigorous strokes. 

" Then I went back to Maigrat's. I pleaded with 
him, saying it wouldn't do him any harm to be just. 
That bothered him; he tried to get away from me." 

Now she was making his back shine like her three 
saucepans did on Saturday, using the back and forth 
movement of the arm until she became so winded that 
her words choked her. 

" At last, calling me an old crank, he said we could 
have bread until Saturday; and the best of it is that he 
lent me a hundred sous. ... I bought some but- 
ter, coffee, chicory and even a little hogs-head of cheese 
of him. Then I paid eighteen sous for potatoes, and I 
still have seventy-five left. So you see, my morning 
wasn't lost." 

She was wiping him dry, while he, happy, not think- 
ing of the debt, caught her up in his arms and kissed 
her. 

"Leave me alone, goose! you're not dry yet. . . . 
I'm afraid, though, that Maigrat's thinking of some- 
thing." 

She was going to speak of Catherine, but paused. 

What use to make him uneasy? 

*'Whatof ?'' 



GEEMINAL. 101 

"Oh! of robbing us. We must watch him, that's 
all." 

"When he was thoroughly dry, Maheu simply put on a 
pair of pants. His greatest enjoyment, after his bath, 
was to sit for a time with arms and chest bare. In 
summer the men Avould all go outside after bathing, 
and, in spite of the dam]^ weather, he went to the door 
for a moment to call across the garden to another man, 
with shoulders equally bare. Then others appeared at 
their doors, all smiling from the comfort of a good 
bowl of soup and a warm bath. Even the children, 
lying upon the pavement, raised themselves and laughed 
also at the happiness around them. 

While drinking his coffee, Maheu told his wife of the 
engineer's anger about the timbering. He was calm 
now, and listened with an approving nod to the wise 
counsels of la Maheu, who showed a great amount of 
wisdom in these affairs. She always repeated to him 
that they would gain nothing by opposing the company. 

Finally, she informed him of the visit of Madame 
Hennebeau. 

" Can I come down? asked Catherine from the head 
of the stairs." 

" Yes, your father is dry." 

The young girl had put on her Sunday dress, a dark 
blue poplin, already faded and worn. On her head 
was a very simple black tulle bonnet. 

"Why, you've dressed yourself up. Where are you 
going?" 

" I'm going to Montson to buy some ribbon for my 
bonnet. I've taken off the old one; it was too dirty." 

"Then you've got some money?" 

"No, Mouquette promised to lend me ten sous." 

The mother let her go as far as the door, then called 
her back. 

"Listen; don't go to Maigrat to buy your ribbon. 
He'll rob you and believe we're rolling in gold." 

The father, sitting by the fire, added: 

"Don't stay out too long." 

In the afternoon, Maheu worked in his garden. He 
had already planted some potatoes, beans and peas, and 
to-day he intended transplanting some cabbage and 
lettuce. This garden furnished them with all their 



102 GERMIN"AL. 

vegetables except potatoes, of which they never had 
enough. He thoroughly understood gardening, and 
even raised a few artichokes, a thing which his neighbors 
had never been able to do. As he went into the garden 
he saw Levaque who had come out to smoke a pipe and 
look at the lettuce which Bouteloup had planted that 
morning; if his lodger had not have had the courage to 
dig, nothing would have grown there but weeds. A 
conversation was begun across the fence. Levaque, 
excited at having hit his wife, vainly tried to drag 
Mahue to Rasseneur's. A drink didn't frighten him 
did it? They would have a game of skittles, take a 
stroll with their comrades and then return home. 
That was the only pleasure after coming from the 
mine; there could be no harm in it. But Maheu wished 
to transplant his cabbage which he said would be wilted 
next day. In reality he refused because not wishing to 
ask his wife for a liard of the hundred sous. 

It was striking five when la Pierronne came to ask if 
her Lydie had gone off with Jeanlin. Levaque said it 
must be so, for his Bebert had also disappeared, and 
those three children were always together. But when 
Maheu told them they were gatheriug dandelions they 
were satisfied. ■ Now that the school was closed all the 
little ones were in the alley, pulling and beating each 
other, while the fathers, who were not at the saloons, 
squatted in the same position as in the mine, smoking 
their pipes. At last Levaque decided to go oif to 
Rasseneur's alone, but Maheu still went on planting. 

Night had fallen ; la Maheu lit the lamp, provoked 
that neither the girl nor boys had come in. She knew 
not one of them would come to join the only meal 
which they could take together. Moreover, she waited 
for the dandelions. What could they pick at that hour 
in that darkness? A salad was so nice with the stew 
which she had put on the fire, some potatoes, leeks and 
sorrel stewed together, and fried onions, of which the 
entire house smelt ; that good odor which soon became 
rank and penetrated the bricks of the alley with such a 
smell that they could be scented afar off in the country. 

Maheu, after leaving the garden when night came on, 
dozed on a chair, his head against the wall. As soon 
a,s he seated himself he slejjt. The clock struck seven, 



GEKMINAL. 103 

Henri and Lenore broke a plate in obstinately trying to 
assist Alzire, who was setting the table. Bonnemort 
v/as the first to enter and, having liarriedly eaten his 
dinner, he returned to the mine. 

" We may as well eat. . . . They're big enough 
to take care of themselves. The only thing that I don't 
like is there's no salad." 



CHAPTEE XI. 



At Easseneur's, after having eaten a soup, Etienne 
again went up into the little room under the roof, 
which he was to occupy. He had not closed his eyes 
for two days, and overcome by fatigue, without dis- 
robing, he fell upon his bed and slept soundly. When 
he awoke, it was growing dark, he raised his head in 
astonishment, not recognizing where he was; then as a 
faintness came over him, he painfully arose, determined 
to get a breath of fresh air, and after eating his dinner, 
to retire for the night. 

The weather was moderating; the leaden sky had 
become copper-colored, charged with one of those long 
rains of the north, of which the moistness of the air 
denoted the approach. Great smoky clouds rolled by, 
and in the distance settled down on that desert plain. 
Upon this immense sea of reddish earth twilight was 
falling. No sound was heard, not a breath of wind 
was stirring. 

Etienne began walking, with no other purpose than 
to shake off liis feverish feeling. In passing the Voreux, 
where as yet not a lantern shone out, he paused an instant 
to watch the six o'clock exit of miners, who went off in 
groups, mixing with the girls from the screeners, all 
laughing together among the shadows. 

First came la Brule and her son-in-law, Pierron. She 
was quarreling with him because he had not taken her 
part in an argument she had just finished with an over- 
seer. 

" If I was a man, I'd be ashamed to let one of those 
overseers get the best of me." 



104 GERMINAL. 

Pierron, who had been silently walking on, said at 
last: 

*' Well, perhaps I ought to have jumped on the chief. 
But I've no time for that now." 

" If my daughter had listened to me, she would never 
have had anything to do with you." 

Their voices were lost. Etienne watched her disap- 
pear with her eagle-like nose, white hair and long thin 
arms which were gesticulating furiously. Now the 
conversation of two young people arrested his attention. 
He recognized the voices of Zacharie and Moquet. 

*'Are you coming?" asked the latter. "We will eat 
a sandwich and then go to the Volcan." 

"After awhile; Fve something to do now." 

"What?" 

The young man turning around percieved Philomene, 
who was coming from the screenings. He understood. 

" Oh, it's that? Well, I'll go on." 

"Yes, I'll catch up with you." 

As he moved off, Moquet met his father who was also 
leaving the Voreux; the two men simply said good 
evening, the son taking the main road while the old 
man slowly went off by the canal. 

Zacharie had already stopped Piiiloméne, pushing her 
to one side of the road in spite of her resistance. 

" I've something to say to you," said he impatiently. 

Taking her arm he led her off in the darkness, asking 
her if she hadn't some money. 

"What for?" she demanded. 

Becoming confused he spoke of a debt of two francs 
which he owed. 

" Shut up, now. I saw Moquet; you are going to the 
Volcan to see those nasty women singers." 

He crossed himself, swearing it was not so. Then, 
when she shrugged her shoulders, he said suddenly: 

" Come with us if you want to. You see that don't 
bother me. What do I v/ant with those singers?" 

" And the baby?" she replied. You know I can't 
stir, for she's always crying. Let me go home. They're 
mad now, I'll bet." 

But he detained her, saying he did not want to appear 
foolish before Moquet whom he had promised. A man 
couldn't go to bed with the hens every evening. Van- 



GEKMINAL. 105 

quislied, she turned up the skirt of her dress, and rip- 
ping the hem, drew out some ten sou pieces. For fear 
of being robbed by her mother, she hid there the money 
she made at extra work in tlie mine. 

"I've got five, you see," she said. "You may have 
three. Only first you must swear that you'll persuade 
your mother to let us get married. . . . Swear, 
swear first." 

She spoke in the tired voice of a great sickly girl, 
without passion, simply weary of existence. He swore, 
saying that was already a promised thing; then, when 
she gave him the three pieces, he kissed her, and allow- 
ing her to return to the alley alone, cut across the fields 
to overtake his comrade. 

Etienne had mechanically followed them, but, not 
hearing their words, believed it a simple rendezvouz. 
A little further on other voices were heard. 

Seated on a heap of stones, there was Jeanlin, with 
Bebert on one side and Lydie on the other. 

" What did you sav? I'll give you a slaj) if you growl. 
Who thought of this'^first?" 

Jeanlin, after lying for an hour along the canal, went 
to the meadows and gathered dandelions, assisted by 
the two others. Suddenly the thought came to him 
that they might be converted into money, and, instead 
of going home, they went to Montson, sending the 
little girl from door to door, selling the greens, until 
not one was left. They made eleven sous, and now 
with empty hands they were dividing the gain. 

" That's not fair," said Bebert. " If you keep seven 
sous we'll only have two apiece." 

" What's not fair," replied Jeanlin, furious; "didn't 
I pick more than you?" 

The other generally yielded with timid a submission, 
a stupidity which rendered him the continual victim of 
his comrade. Older and stronger, he even allowed 
himself to be slapped. But this time, the thought of 
all that money excited him to resistance. 

"He's stealing from us, isn't he Lydie. If he don't 
divide we'll tell his mother." 

Jeanlin stuck out his tongue at them. 

" Say one word and I'll go and tell them at your 
house that you've sold the salad to my mother. And 



106 GERMINAL. 

besides, you stupid fools, I can't divide eleven sous in 
three parts, don't you see? Here are two sous. If you 
don't want them I'll put them back in my pocket." 

Subdued, Bebert accepted his portion. Lydie, who 
was afraid of Jeanlin, had said nothing. When he 
offered her the money she held out her hand with a sub- 
missive smile. But he suddenly changed his mind. 

" What would you do with all that money ? Your 
mother'll take it from you, for you don't know enougli 
to hide it. I'd better take care of it for you. When 
you want some money you can ask me for it." 

The nine sous disappeared. To prevent her from 
crying he tickled her, making her laugh, and then 
romping through the fields she soon forgot her childish 
grief. 

A hundred steps farther on, Etienne met another 
coupie, who were going to Requillart, where, around the 
old ruined mine, all the girls of Montson assembled 
with their lovers. The falling sheds, long since aban- 
doned, were still standing, while here and there a half 
rotten coal car obstructed the way. A thick vegetation 
had covered that corner of the ground, a wild grass and 
some young trees already strong. In that spot all the 
girls were at home ; there was room enough for all ; 
some sat upon overturned logs, while others even took 
up their stay in the cars. 

A keeper lived there, old Moque, to whom the com- 
pany had given two rooms almost under the ruined 
tower, apartments which were constantly threatened 
with complete annihilation from the falling timbers. 
He had even been compelled to prop up the ceiling ; 
but they lived very comfortably there, he and his ^son, 
in one room, the daughter in the other. When every 
pane of glass was gone from the windows, he had kept 
out the cold by nailing on some boards; they made it 
dark but then it was warm. This ilieeper occupied 
himself but little with that old mine, spending the most 
of his time in the Voreux caring for his horses. 

Moque passed his old age there among these boys 
and girls, courting in every corner. His daughter 
began at ten years of age. Lovers succeeded each 
other; but, as she kept them from her home, he did not 
complain, only he growled occasionally when, on going 



GEEMINAL, 107 

to gather wood for the soup, or to find some nuts for 
his rabbits, he would stumble over a couple seated in 
the grass with arms entwined round each other's waists. 
He nodded his head with silent regrets on turning 
aside from these young people. Oh! that youth which 
was gone. 

Every evening, before dinner, old Bonnemort paid a 
visit to his friend Moque. These two old men spoke 
but little, exchanging scarcely ten words in the half 
hour they spent together. But they found happiness 
in thus sitting on a log with heads on their breasts, 
musing of the days gone by. No doubt they became 
young again, as around them floated the same kisses, 
whispers and laughs in which they had taken part 
forty-three years before. A.h! they also had passed 
happy hours there. And the two old men shook their 
heads, often leaving each other without even saying 
good-night. 

That evening, just as Etienne arrived, Bonnemort 
started towards the alley, saying: 

'* Good-night, old boy! . . . Say, now, you 
knew la Rouisse, didn't you?" 

Moque, for 'an instant, stood silent, then shrugging 
his shoulders he re-entered the house. 

" Good-night, good-night, old fellow!" 

Etienne sat down on the log which they had just va- 
cated. He was sad without knowing why. The old 
man, whom he watched disappearing in the distance, 
recalled to him his arrival of the morning and the 
flood of words which the wind had caught up and car- 
ried away. Perhaps it saddened him to be alone at that 
hour, when all the others had gone off two by two. 
The heavy atmosphere suffocated him. Occasional 
drops of rain fell upon his feverish hands, adding to 
his discomfort. 

As Etienne remained seated, motionless in the gloom, 
a couple coming from Monston passed without being 
noticed by him. The girl, as though brought there 
against her will, plead with low supplicating whispers, 
while the man without a word hurried her on. It was 
Catherine and Cheval. But Etienne had not recog- 
nized them in passing and he followed them with a 
glance of curiosity. 



108 GEEMIN'AL. 

On leaving the alley, Catherine had gone to Monston. 
Ever since she had begun working in the mine, she had 
thus run the roads alone in that complete liberty of 
mining families. After passing the company's coal 
yards, she crossed the road and entered the house of a 
wash-woman where she was certain of finding Mou- 
quette, who passed hours there each day. But she was 
disappointed. The girl could not lend lier the money. 
To console her they offered her a cup of hot coffee, but 
she would take nothing. A sudden thought of economy 
arose in her mind, a sort of superstitious fear, a pre- 
sentiment that, if she now bought the ribbon, it would 
bring her un happiness. 

Hastening back on the road to the alley, she was at 
the last house in Montson when a man, standing before 
the Piquette coffee house, called her: 

*' Halloa! Catherine, where are you running so fast?" 

It was Cheval. She, however, was contrary, in no 
mood for laughing. 

^'Come in and take something, will you. Just a 
glass of sometliing sweet." 

She refused politely. It was growing dark; they 
were waiting for her at home. He advanced, begging 
her in a low voice to enter. But she smiled, saying she 
did not have time. Then, from one thing to another, 
she spoke on, and without thinking told him of the 
ribbon which she had been unable to purcliase. 

" I'll pay for one for you," he exclaimed. 

She blushed, feeling it would be better for her to 
refuse, but, filled with a great desire to have her ribbon, 
at last she accepted on condition that the amount paid 
for it should be returned to him. This jileased him, 
for he was convinced that if she would not become his 
girl, slie would return his money. Then another 
difficulty arose when lie wished to go to Maigrat's shop. 

"No, mamma said I shouldn't go there." 

"Never mind, you don't have to tell where you go. 
He keeps the best ribbon in Montson." 

When Maigrat saw them enter, like two lovers buying 
their wedding finery, he grew very red, throwing down 
his blue ribbon with the rage of a man who lias been 
made a fool of. Y/lien they left the store he went to 
the door and watched them as they slowly moved away 



GERMIKAL. 109 

in the falling night. When his wife timidly came to 
ask for some information, he turned upon her, heaping 
up abuse, exclaiming he woukl make those people who 
were wanting in gratitude repent some day. 

On the road, Cheval walked close to Catherine, di- 
recting her steps without appearing to. Suddenly she 
noticed he had left the mam road and was going toward 
Requillart. But he did not give her time to become 
angry; directing her thoughts with a continual flow of 
carressing words. She was foolish to be afraid of hmi; 
he would do her no harm. She, frightened, could find 
nothing to reply; and, closing her eyes on him, an- 
other form, that of the man engaged that morning, 
passed in the darkness before her. 

Looking around her she perceived they had just en- 
tered the ruins of Requillart, and she shivered with fear 
before the blackness of the tumble-down shed into 
which he continued to push her. 

Meanwhile Eteinne had not stirred. But growing 
weary of this love-making, he strode across the ground, 
thinking these two people were too much occupied to be 
disturbed. After taking about thirty steps, on turning 
around, he was surprised to see them coming along as 
thongh making for the alley. 

Then, wishing to see their faces, Etienne paused at 
the first street lamp. He was stupefied on recognizing 
Catherine and Cheval. He could scarcely believe it,* 
was that young girl in a dark blue dress the youngster 
he had seen in linen pantaloons, with hair knotted 
under a scarf ? But he no longer doubted; he saw her 
eyes with their greenish limpidness, like spring water, 
so clear and so deep. 

Catherine and Cheval had passed him, not knowing 
they vrere being Avatched. And he now followed them 
at a short distance, mad with rage at tlicse lovers who 
seemed so happy. For a half hour this walk continued. 
"When the couple approached the Voreux he still kept 
behind them, while they stopped now and then along 
the way as though too happy to go further. When he 
reached Rasseneur's, instead of entering the house, he 
accompanied them as far as the alley, standing in the 
shadows for a quarter of an hour while they said good- 
night. When he was positive they were no longer to- 



110 GERMIKAL. 

gether he walked far off on the road to Marchiennes, too 
angry and too sad to shut himself up in his room. 

An hour later, about nine o'clock, Etienne retraced 
his steps, saying to himself he must eat and sleep if he 
wanted to be out at three o'clock. Every one in the 
alley was sleeping in the dark night. Not a light shone 
from the closed window blinds. Only a frightened cat 
i*an off across the empty gardens. It was the close of 
the workingmen's day, who fell from the table to the 
bed, overcome with fatigue. 

At Kasseneur's, a machinist and two day workmen 
were still drinking. But before entering Etienne 
paused for a last look into the darkness. Again he 
found the same black immensity of the morning when 
he had arrived by the main road. Before him, the 
Voreux crouched like a night animal. The three fires 
of live coal burned in the air like reddening moons; 
and below, on the open plain, the darkness had sub- 
merged all, Montson, Marchiennes and the forest of 
Vandame, the vast fields of wheat and beets, while 
only the blue fires from the high furnaces and the red 
coke fires, shone out like beacon lights amid all that 
darkness. The rain was now falling, a slow, continued 
and monotonous streaming. One single sound was 
heard, the great, slow, respiration of the engine which, 
like a human being, day and night breathed on. 



CHAPTER XII. 



The next day and the days following Etienne re- 
sumed his labors at the mine. He became accustomed 
to the work and the new habits, which had seemed so 
hard to him at first. Before a half month was over, he 
was seized with a fever which racked his limbs, while 
with head as though on fire he dreamed in a half deliri- 
um that he was determinedly pushing his car to the end 
of a passage so narrow that his body could not enter. 
It was simply extreme lassitude from his apprenticeship, 
an excess of fatigue from which he soon recovered. 

The days followed each other; weeks, months glided 
by. Now, like his comrades, he rose at three o'clock, 



GERMINAL. Ill 

drank his coffee and went off, carrying his slice of bread 
and butter, which Madame Rasseneur had prepared for 
him the day before. Every morning on his way to the 
mine, he met old Bonnemort who was going home to 
rest, while, on leaving it, he met Bouteloup. He wore 
a blouse and breeches like his companions, and shivered 
with cold and warmed his back at the waiting room be- 
fore the great fire. Then came the walk in bare feet;, 
through the chilling air, to the superintendent's office. 
His attention was no longer attracted by the engine, 
shining out in the darkness with its copper and steel, 
the cables flying so silently, like birds in the night, the 
cages ceaselessly going up and down amid the uproar of 
the signals and the cars rolling over the flagging» His 
lamp burned badly, that confounded cleaner had not 
washed it; but he smiled good naturedly as Moquet 
slapped him on the back. The cage being unhooked, 
fell like a stone to the bottom of the shaft, without liis 
even turning his head to see the daylight pass away. He 
had never thought such a fall possible, but he became 
more and more accustomed to that descent in the dark- 
ness under a beating shower. Below, in the main room, 
when Pierron had let them out with his air of hypocrit- 
ical meekness there was stamping of feet as the miners 
went off, with lagging step, each to his own drift. He 
now knew the galleries of the mine better than the 
streets of Monston, knowing when to turn, when to 
stoop and where to avoid a stream of water. He had 
become so accustomed to these two kilometres under 
the ground that he could have walked without a lamp, 
his hands in his pockets. Each day he met the same 
people in the passage; an overseer lighting up the faces 
of the workmen, old Moque leading a horse, Bebert 
driving Bataille who was snorting, Jeanlin running be- 
hind a train of cars to shut the ventilating doors, and 
little Lydie pushing her car 

Later, Etienne suffered less, both from the damp- 
ness and the confined air of the drift; even his section 
of the mine seemed less difficult; he would push through 
crevices where in olden times he would not have risked 
his hand. The coal dust no longer obstructed his 
breathing; seeing clearly m the night, perspiring freely, 
he had become accustomed to working from morning 



112 GERMINAL. 

until uight, wet to the skin. No more strength was 
awkwardly wasted. He became a good workman so 
quickly that all were astonished. At the end of three 
weeks he was called one of the best pushers in the mine 
— none rolled his car to the incline more quickly than 
he or packed it more correctly. His beautifully formed 
arms, white as a woman's, possessed an iron strength. 
His manliness restrained complaint, even though almost 
dead with fatigue. They only reproached him for his 
unwillingness to take a joke. He was regarded, how- 
ever, as a true miner, who, like them, from the force of 
habit, had become as a machine. 

Among them Maheu especially respected Etienne as 
one who never slighted his work. And, like the others, 
he felt that this boy was his superior; he saw him read, 
write and even draw designs, while he talked of things 
even of the existence of which they were ignorant. 
That did not astonish him much; miners were rough 
men, with harder heads than machinists; but he was 
surprised at the courage of this boy, his coolness in 
accepting his fate rather than die of hunger. This 
v,'as the first man he had known to so quickly fall into 
the ways of the mine. When the propping was urgent 
and he did not wish to disturb a miner, he assigned the 
v/ork of timbering to him, certain of its correctness 
and solidity. The chiefs were always tormenting him 
about that cursed work; every moment he feared to see 
the engineer, Megrel, appear, followed by Dansaert. 
The propping of his pusher seemed to satisfy these 
gentlemen better; m spite of their dissatisfied airs and 
their remarks, that one of these days the company 
would take radical measures. These things developed 
a slow discontent throughout the mine. Even Maheu, 
ordinarily so calm, came to the point of shaking his fist. 

At first a rivalry sprung up between Zacharie and 
Etienne, and, one evening, on coming to blows, the 
latter was the victor; but the former, showing no ill 
will, immediately offered him a drink. Even Levaque, 
professing the same political views, had now become 
friendly to him. But he still felt a great hostility to- 
ward Cheval; no coldness had sprung up between them, 
on the contrary, they had become comrades; only, at 



GERMINAL. 113 

times, even while joking with each other, a glance of 
hatred passed between them. 

Spring had come. One day, on going from the shaft, 
Etienne felt upon his cheek the warm wind of April, 
and sensed the good smell of fresh earth, green fields, 
and pure air. Now each day the balmy spring air 
warmed him more and more after his ten hours of labor 
in eternal winter, amid that damp darkness which even 
summer could not dissipate. The da3fs passed by. In 
May he descended at sunrise, when the gray dawn 
brightened into vermillion tints, lighting up the Voreux 
with misty rays of crimson and gold. The miners 
going to their work no longer shivered, for a warm 
breeze floated over the plain, while the rising larks 
caroled their matin song. Then, at three o'clock, he 
ascended the shaft to find the sun's declining rays 
tinging the whole earth with lustrous beauty. In June 
the wheat fields were already high, showing a light 
green, contrasting strongly with the more somber hue 
of the beet fields. It was one boundless waving sea, 
whose billows seemed to increase each evening with the 
growth of vegetation. Along the canal, the poplars 
with their leafy branches enhanced the beauty of the 
scene. Weeds interlaced with wild flowers covered the 
old mine, showing that mother earth at this vernal 
season had given all nature a new life. 

Now, as Etienne, walked forth in the evening, it was 
no longer behind the old ruins that he surprised the 
lovers. He could follow them in the unobstructed 
wheat fields. Zacharie and Philoméne had returned to 
their old trysting place, while old mother Brule vainly 
sought the hiding place of Jeanlin and Lydie in the 
moving grain ; and as for Moquette, one could not 
traverse a field without seeing her head rising from the 
stalks. Twice he saw Catherine and Cheval, at his 
approach, hide themselves in the midst of a field whose 
stalks remained motionless. Then that immense plain 
seemed too small to him; he preferred passing the even- 
ing at Rasseneur's. 

" Give me a drink, Madame Rasseneur. ... I 
won't go out this evening; I'm tired." 

And he turned toward a comrade, seated at the end 
of the room, his head against the wall. 



114 GERMINAL. 

" Won't you take soraetliing, Jouvarine?'' 

*' No, thank you, nothing at all." 

Etienne had become acquainted with Jouvarine; he 
lived in the same house. He was a machinist at the 
Voreux, who occupied the room next to his, and was 
about thirty years of age, a slender blonde, with a fine 
head, covered with splendid hair, and a thin beard. 
His little, white pointed teeth, his small mouth and 
nose, with a pink and white comjalexion, gave him a 
girlish look and an air of careless amiability; but the 
pale reflection of his steel gray eyes at times flashed 
fiercely. His scantily furnished chamber contained a 
case of books and papers. He was a Russian, and his 
reticence in manner gave rise to the suspicion, on the part 
of his fellow-workmen that, with his little gentleman- 
like hands, he belonged to a higher class; perhaps he 
was an adventurer or an assasin, eluding punishment. 
But then, he had proved to be so friendly, giving to 
the children in the alley all the sous from his pockets, 
that they accepted him as a comrade, reassured by the 
words " political refugee " which had been circulated, 
those vague words m which they saw an excuse even 
for crime. 

The first week, Etienne had found him reserved, al- 
most fierce. He did not know his history until much 
later. Jouvarine was the last born of a noble family of 
Toula. At St Petersburg, when he had studied medi- 
cine, the socialist rage which carried away all the Eus- 
sian youths, had decided him to become a mechanic, 
mingle with the people, and so know and aid them as a 
brother. By that experience he was able to live now, 
having fled after an attempt on the life of the Emperor. 
For a month he had lived in the hut of a fruiterer. 
Disowned by his family, without money, marked as a 
stranger on the books of all the French workshops, 
they thought him a spy, and he was dying of hunger 
when the Monston company employed him in an hour 
of need. He had labored there for a year, a good 
workman, sober and silent, working alternately day and 
night, so faithfully, that the chiefs pointed to him as 
an example. 

" Are you never thirsty," said Etienne laughing. 

He replied in a sweet voice, almost without accent: 



GERMIÎfAL. 115 

"I am thirsty when I eat." Then his companion 
Joked him about the girls, swearing he had seen him 
walking with one a few nights before. He shrugged 
his shoulders, filled with calm indifference. "' No," he 
wished no shackles, neither woman nor friend. 

Every evening about nine o'clock, when the saloon 
was empty, Etienne remained there totalk to Jouvarine. 
He drank his beer in little swallows while the other 
continually smoked cigarettes, the nicotine from which 
liad stained his delicate fingers. His thoughtful eyes 
seemed to follow, the smoke as though in a dream, 
while, to prevent the aimless fumbling of his left hand, 
hei nvariably took upon his knees a tame rabbit that had 
the freedom of the house. This rabbit which he had 
named Pologne, was greatly attached to him, and would 
stand erect, scratching him with her paws until he took 
her up like an iiifant. She nestled up to him, her ears 
turned over, shutting her eyes, while without cause, 
almost unconsciously carressing her, he passed his hand 
over her gray silky skin, calmed by the presence of that 
living warmth. 

" Do you know," said Etienne one evening. " I've 
received another letter from Plu chart." There was no 
one there but Easseneur. The last customer had just 
left, returning to the alley where everyone was retiring 
for the night. 

"Ah!" cried the landlord, standing before his two 
lodgers. " What does he say ?" 

For two months Etienne had been carrying on a 
regular correspondence with the machinest at Lille, 
whom he had at first informed of his engagement at 
Monston and who had subsequently desired that he 
should form a society from the Monston miners. 

" He says that the association goes on very well. It 
seems that they conquer on all sides." 

"What do you think of the idea?" said Easseneur to 
Jouvarine. 

The latter, who was tenderly scratching Pologne's 
head, emitted a cloud of smoke and said with his calm 
air: 

"Foolishness." 

But Etienne grew angry. He wished to form a 
branch of the International Association of Workmen, 



116 GERMINAL. 

that famous "International" which Inid just been 
established in London. " Was not this the country for 
such an effort, where Justice would at last triumph?" 
In all parts of the world organizations of this kind 
were being established, to secure the lawful demands of 
the workmen. What a simple yet grand society; lowest 
of all the section which represented the commune; 
above that the federation; then the province which 
grouped the sections; still higher the nation; and above 
all humanity, incarnated in a general council where 
each nation is represented by a corresponding secretary. 
In six months they would conquer the world, they 
would dictate laws to all industries, regulating universal 
labor. 

" Foolishness," repeated Jouvarine. *' I've talked 
that all over. . . . Your Karl Marx is willing that 
this matter should govern itself and the only concerted 
effort should be with reference to increasing the wages 
of workingmen. I do not believe in your ideas. Burn 
everything; crush the people; annihilate all; and, when 
nothing remains of this rotten world, perhaps, from its 
ruins, a better one will arise." 

Etienne commenced laughing. He did not always 
listen to the words of his comrade. This thing of dis- 
tinction seemed to him futile. Easseneur, still more 
practical, and with the knowledge of an experienced 
man, did not even condescend to become angry. 

" Then you're going to attempt to form a branch in 
Monston, are you?" 

That was what Pluchart, who was Secretary of the 
Federation of the North, desired. He particularly dwelt 
on the assistance tlie association would be to the miners, 
if they were to strike. Etienne thought a great deal 
of the coming strike; the affair about timbering would 
end badly; it needed only a very slight act of injustice 
on the part of the company to arouse all the miners. 

" The great trouble is the dues," said Easseneur in 
a contemplative tone. ''Fifty centimes a year for the 
general funds, and two francs for the section; that does 
not seem like anything, but I am sure many would re- 
fuse to give it." 

"So much the more reason why we should have a 



GERMINAL. 117 

saving fund," said Etienne. "It's time to think of all 
this. I'm ready, if the othi-rs are." 

There was a silence. The oil lamp on the box was 
smoking. Through the open door, they distinctly heard 
the sound of a fireman engaged in replenishing the 
furnace. 

" Everything is so dear," replied Madame Rassenenr, 
who had entered and was listening with a gloomy air, 
so stately in her eternal black dress. "Would you be- 
lieve that I have paid twenty-two sous for eggs? This 
cannot last. 

This time the three men were of the same mind. 
They spoke one after the otlier in a despairing tone, 
and complaints fell fast. The workman could not 
stand this; the revolution only increased his misery; 
since '89 the owners were rolling in wealth, leaving the 
miners to feel the pinchings of poverty. If the work- 
men had been permitted to share in the profits of the 
last hundred years things would have been different. 
It was absurd to call them free: yes, free to die of 
hunger, while they denied themselves nothing. It did 
not put bread in the cupboard to vote for men who 
would take their ease without thinking more of their 
people than of their old boots. This state of things 
should end. The children ought to be able to see that, 
if the old people could not, this century "would not end 
without another revolution, this time of the workmen, 
a battle which would clean away society from high to 
low, and rebuild it with more propriety and justice. 

"This must end," repeated Madame Easseneur, en- 
ergetically. 

"Yes, yes," cried all three, 'Mt must end." 

Jouvarine was stroking Pologne's ears, whose nose 
was curled up with pleasure. He said, in a low voice, 
with ej'es lost in the distance, as if speaking to himself: 

"Increase the salaries. Why, they are fixed by an 
inexorable law at the smallest possible sum, just enough 
to allow the workmen to eat dry bread. If they fall 
too low, the workmen die, and the demand for new men 
makes them rise again. If they go up too high, the 
losses are so much greater that they drop again. It is 
the equilibrium of empty stomachs, the perpetual con- 
demnation to a fate like that of the galley slave." 



118 GERMIÎs^AL. 

When he forgot himself in that way, approaching 
some subject of socialism, Etienne and liasseneiir be- 
came uneasy, troubled by his lugubrious remarks, to 
which they could not respond. 

'* Listen," he resumed in his usual calm manner; "it 
will be necessary to destroy all non-producers. Yes, 
even to bathe the earth in blood, to purify it by fire." 

"Monsieur is right, said Madame Kasseneur, who, in 
her fits of revolutionary excitement, became very polite. 

Etienne, in despair at his ignorance, did not wish to 
discuss the matter furthei". He arose, saying: 

" Let us go to bed. All this cannot relieve me from 
getting np at three o'clock." 

Jouvarine, with one last puâ at his cigarette, arose, 
tenderly placing the rabbit on the floor. Easseneur 
closed up the house and they all ascended the stairs in 
silence, their ears buzzing, their heads swelling with 
the great questions which had so stirred them. 

Every evening there was some such conversation in 
the bar-room, over the cup which it took Etienne an 
hour to empty. The more he talked the greater his 
anxiety became to solve this vexed problem. Eor a 
long time he hesitated about borrowing some books 
from his neiglibor, who unhappily, possessed little but 
English and Eussian works. At length he procured 
from him a few books upon the co-operative system, 
more foolishness, as Jouvarine said. Every week he 
read a paper received by the latter, le Combat, an 
anarchist sheet published at Geneva- In spite of all 
that lie read on the subject, he could not arrive at any 
definite conclusion as to the value of any of the theories 
advanced. 

It was toward the middle of July that Etienne began 
the study of this subject. His monotonous life was in- 
terrupted by an acciden*'; the workmen of the vein 
Guillaume came upon a strange sight in the bed, which 
indicated the presence of a dyke, and, in fact, they 
soon encountered a formation, of which the engineers, 
in spite of their experience in such matters, were still 
ignorant. It traversed the mine; they only spoke of 
the disappearing vein; without doubt it ran down on 
the other side of the dyke. 

Like hounds following the scent of a fox, the old

miners apprehended danger. While waiting the dig- 
gers conld not remain idle; and some placards an- 
nounced that the company would open some new drifts. 

One day, on leaving the mine, Maheu led Etienne 
aside and offered to employ him as a miner in place of 
Levaque, who had gone over to another drift. The af- 
fair had already been arranged with the overseer and 
the engineer, who were well satisfied with the young 
man. So Etienne accepted this sudden advancement 
happy at the growing esteem in which Maheu held him. 

That evening they again returned to the mine to read 
the placards. The drafts for employment were found 
to be at the vein Fillouière, in the north gallery of the 
Voreux. They seemed of little advantage; the old 
miner shook his head as the young man read to him 
the conditions. The day after, when they descended 
and went to look at the vein, he called attention to the 
distance from the main chamber, the insecurity of the 
ground, and the thin but tough layers of coal. But if 
one wished to eat it was necessary to work. So, on the 
following Sunday, they went together to the sale, which 
was to take place in the Avaiting-room. The mine 
engineer, assisted by the superintendent, presided in 
the absence of the engineer of the division. Five or 
or six hundred coal-miners were there in front of the 
little platform, built in the corner, and the sale began 
in such a tumult that one only heard a number of 
voices, while some figures were called out, only to be 
superseded by others. 

At first Maheu feared he would not be able to obtain 
one of the four drifts offered by the company. All the 
competitors were uneasy at the cries, seized with fright 
by the cessation of labor. The engineer, Migrel, was 
anxious to obtain the lowest figures possible, while Dan- 
saert, desirous of hastening the affair, lied about the ex- 
cellence of the bargain. To obtain his fifty metres, 
Maheu was compelled to fight against a comrade, who 
also became excited; they each bid a centime a car; but 
the superintendent, Eichomme, became angry, saying 
it could never be let at that price. 

On leaving, Etienne swore, and he broke out before 
Cheval, who was going to stroll with Catherine in the 



120 GERMINAL. 

wheat fields, while her father occupied himself with the 
serious affairs. 

'* Great heavens !" he exclaimed, '' now the working- 
men are even forced to devour each other." 

Cheval flew into a passion; he would never lower him- 
self like that, and even Zacharie, out of sympathy, de- 
clared it was disgusting. But Etienne silenced them 
with a violent gestuae. 

" This shall end; we will be masters one day." 

Maheu, who had remained silent since the sale, 
seemed to rouse himself. He repeated: 

"Masters ? Well, it can^t be too soon." 



CHAPTEE XIII. 



It was the last Sunday in July, the day of the 
''Ducasse de Montson." On Saturday the good house- 
keepers had washed their rooms, with pail after pail of 
water thrown with great rapidity upon the hearth and 
against the walls. The floor was not yet dry, in spite 
of the white sand with which they had sprinkled it, an 
expensive luxury for the purses of the poor. The day 
commenced very warm, with one of those lowering, 
heavy skies foretelling a thunderstorm, which in sum- 
mer, deluged, drowned these flat countries of the 
North. 

At Maheu's they rose later on Sunday. This morn- 
ing, after smoking a pipe in his garden, the father 
entered the house to eat a slice of bread and butter all 
alone while waiting for the others to come down-stairs. 
He passed the morning not knowning how to occupy 
his time. He mended the leaky tub, and put up under 
the clock a portrait of the Prince Imperial, which some 
one had given the little ones. At last the others came 
down, one by one. Old Bonnemort took out a chair to 
sit in the sun; the mother and Alzire busied them- 
selves with preparing the morning meal. Catherine 
appeared with Lenore and Henri, whom she had just 
dressed. Eleven o'clock struck; the odor of rabbit, 
stewing with potatoes, was already filling the house. 



GERMINAL. 121 

when Zacharie and Jeanlin came down the last, their 
eyes swollen, and still yawuing. 

All the alley was astir, while, in holiday attire, they 
hastily ate their dinners, and started for Montson. 
Bands of children played around the doors; men, in 
their shirt- sleeves, lounged about lazily enjoying the 
day of rest. The windows and doors, wide ojien, gave 
a view of all the rooms with their occupants, while the 
hum of noisy voices floated out upon the warm air. 
And from one end of the alley to the other the smell of 
rabbit, contended that day with the odor of fried 
onions. 

The Maheus dined at twelve o'clock. They took no 
part in the noise outside. For three weeks they had 
been on bad terms with their neighbors — the Levaques — 
on the subject of the marriage between Zacharie and 
Philomêne. The men were friendly, but the women re- 
fused to recognize each other. This quarrel had 
increased the intimacy with la Pierronne. But the 
latter, leaving her husband, mother and little Lydie, 
had set out early in the morning to pass the day with a 
cousin at Marchiennes. The neighbors joked over this, 
for they knew that counsin. She was the superintend- 
ent of the Voreux. La Maheu declared it was not 
right for her to leave her family on the "Ducasse" 
Sunday. 

Li addition to the rabbit, which they had fattened in 
the coop for a month, and the potatoes, Maheu had a 
rich, beef soup. The day before was pay day. They 
never remembered having such a treat. Even at the 
last Sainte-Barbe, that fête of the miners when they do 
nothing for three days, the rabbit had not been so fat 
or so tender. The ten sets of teeth, from those of Es- 
telle which had commenced to push through to old 
Bonnemort with his few remaining stumps, worked 
with such vigor that the bones themselves disappeared. 
It was good, but would be digested badly, because they 
saw it so rarely. Nothing remained for the evening 
but a piece of boiled meat. So that they could add 
some slices of bread and butter if hungry. 

Jeanlin was the first to disappear. Bebert was wait- 
ing for him on the other side of the garden. Lydie 



122 GERMINAL. 

managed to slip away from la Brule, who had decided 
not to go out and to keep the child with her. 

When she found that the little one had gone, she 
screamed with rage, while Pierron, annoyed by this 
outburst, quietly went off for a stroll. 

Finally Bonnemort started forth, and Maheu also de- 
cided to take the air, after having first asked his wife if 
she would go with him. But she could not; it was 
real drudgery with the little ones; perhaps later on she 
could join him. Outside, he hesitated, then entered 
his neighbor's house to see if Levaque Avas ready. 
There he found Zacharie waiting for Philomene; ai.d 
her mother again began on the eternal subject of their 
marriage, saying that they imposed on her, she must 
have another talk with la Maheu. Was it right to keep 
her daughter without a husband and the children with- 
out a father? Philomene quietly put on her hat and 
Zacharie led her away, saying that he was willing when- 
ever his mother was. Maheu told them to talk to his 
wife and he also went off. Bouteloup, who was eating 
a piece of cheese with both elbows on the table, obsti- 
nately refused his offer of a drink. He preferred re- 
maining at home. 

By degrees the alley was vacated, all the men going 
off alone, one behind the other, while the girls walked 
away leaning on the arms of their lovers. When her 
father had turned the church corner, Catherine, per- 
ceiving Cheval, hastened to join him, taking the road 
to Montson. The mothers remained alone amid their 
disorderly children, not having the strength to leave 
their chairs, and pouring out cup after cup of coffee 
which they drank in little swallows. 

Maheu, thinking that Levaque was at l'Avantage, 
slowly went off toward Easseneu's. In the garden be- 
hind the shop, Levaque was one of a party at skittles. 
Bonnemort and old Moque stood by watching the balls, 
so much absorbed that they could not keep their 
thoughts to themselves. A burning sun shone down, 
and the only spot of shade was along the tavern, where 
Etienne sat at a table drinking his beer, weary of the 
book which Jouvarine had lent him to take up in his 
room. The machinist spent almost every Sunday 
writing and reading. 



GEEMINAL. 123 

" "Won't you play? " said Levaque to Maheu. 

But the latter refused. He was warm and almost 
dying of thirst. 

"Rasseueur!" called Etienne, " bring us a drink/' 

And then turning toward Maheu: 

"This drink is with me." 

Easseneur seemed to be in no hurry. They called 
three times, and then it was Madame who, with 
her polite air, carried out the warm, insipid beer. The 
young man complained of the house. They were good 
people, no doubt, but their beer was bad and the soup 
execrable. He would have changed his boarding-house 
long ago, if he had not dreaded the walk to and from 
Montson. Some day he would try to find a family in 
the alley to take him. 

" Yes," said Maheu, in his slow way, "you'd be bet- 
ter off in a family. 

But laughs broke out. Levaque had won the game. 
Moque and Bonnemort, with their noses toward the 
ground, in the midst of all the tumult, maintained the 
silence of profound dignity. The laughs grew louder, 
as they perceived above the hedge, which surrounded 
the garden, the great jolly face of Moguette, who had 
been lying there for an hour, and was emboldened to 
approach on hearing the noise. 

"How is it you're alone ?" cried Levaque. "Where's 
your beau ?" 

"I haven't any," she replied. "I'm looking for 
one." They all offered themselves, but, with a shake 
of the head, she refused, hiughiug loudly. Her father, 
meanwhile, had not taken his eyes from the balls. 

"Go for him," continued Levaque, throwing a glance 
tovv'ard Etienne. " Bat I don't think he wants you, 
my girl. You'll have to get him by force." 

Etienne laughed, shaking his head, amused, but not 
having tlie least wish to make love to her. For some 
minutes she remained behind the hedge, watching him 
with her great, dull eyes; then she slowly went away, 
her face suddenly sobered, as though overcome by the 
hot sun. 

In a low voice, Ethienne had resumed the explana- 
tions which he was giving to Maheu upon the necessity 



124 GERMINAL. 

for the coal miners of Montson to establish a saving 
fund. 

"The company pretends to leave us free," he said. 
" What do you fear ? I know it gives pensions, but 
they are only according to their own fancy, without 
any reference to our needs. Now, it would be prudent 
to form a mutual aid association, upon which we could 
at least count in case of some immediate want. 

And he entered into details, discussing the organiza- 
tion, and promising to take upon himself all the labor. 

"I'm with you," said Maheu, finally. "If you can 
only get the others." 

Maheu refused to take a second drink; they would 
see each other later; the day was not over yet. He had 
been thinking of Pierron; where could he be? no 
doubt at the smoking-room, at l'Enfant, and Levaque, 
Etienne and himself set out for Montson just as a new 
party of men began a game of skittles. 

First they entered the saloon of Casamie, then the 
one called le Progris. Some comrades called them from 
the open door, and, unable to say no, they went in. 
Each time it was a beer, two if they returned the drinks. 
They remained in each place ten minutes, exchanging 
a few words and then going away. At l'Enfant they 
found Perron, who had finished his second drink, and, 
rather than refuse to toucli glasses, was taking a third. 
Naturally, they drank there also, and then went off to 
see if Zacharie was not at the saloon Tison. That room 
was empty; they called for beers, saying they would 
wait a while for him. Finally they thought of the tav- 
ern Saint Elvi; they accepted there a round of drinks 
from the superintendent, Eichomme, and, after that, 
they went from saloon to saloon without purpose, 
merely for a stroll. 

"Let's go to the Volcan!" said Levaque, suddenly. 
And so they accompanied their comrade into the midst 
of the lively crowd of au fete day. In the long, straight 
room of the Volcan, upon a stage erected at the lower 
end, five cafe èmgers, the trash of Lille, were singing 
songs. All the youths of the mine were gathered there, 
di'inking more gin than beer. A few old miners were 
also seated at the tables, laughing at the rough jokes. 

As soon as their party was grouped around a little 



GEEMIXAL. 125 

table, Etienne took possession of Levaque, explaining 
to him the saving fund. He had the firm faitli of a 
new convert who feels he has a mission to perform. 

Each member, he explained, could well give twenty 
sous a month. With this sum in four or five years they 
could have a great capital, and when they had money 
they would be strong would they not? no matter what 
happened. Well, what did he think of it? 

"' 1 don't know," replied Levaque, with an absent air. 
'' We'll talk over it." 

He was interested in a large blonde, and was anxious 
to remain, when Maheu and Pierron, after having 
drunk more beer, wished to go without waiting for a 
second song. 

Outside, Etienne saw Moquette who seemed to have 
followed them. She was always watching him with her 
dull eyes. But the young man laughed at her, and 
she went off in a passion. 

"Where's Cheval?" asked Pierron. 

" I guess he's at le Piquette," said Maheu. "Let's 
go there." 

When they arrived at le Piquette the sound of a fight 
made them pause. Zacharie was threatening to strike 
a little nail maker, while Cheval, with his hands in his 
pockets, looked on. 

"Stop! here's Cheval," said Maheu quietly. "He's 
with Catherine." 

The girl and her lover had been walking the streets 
for five hours. In the broiling sun, along the Monston 
road, a constant stream of people moved on like a train 
of busy ants. From the dry black earth the dust arose 
in heavy clouds. At each side of the road, with open 
doors, the saloons invited one to enter, while tables 
were ranged as far as the pavement, before which street- 
venders displaying their wares, handkerchiefs, caps and 
mirrors for the girls and knives for the boys, while bon- 
bons and cakes were too numerous to mention. Before 
the church they were playing Archery; at the coal yards 
a game of spittles was going on; and on the road to 
Joi selles, in an inclosed lot, they came upon a cock- 
fight. There were two big, red cocks, armed with iron 
spurs, torn by which the throat of one was bleeding. 
Farther on, at Maigrat's house, they were playing 



126 GERMINAL. 

chequers and billiards. The crowd was getting bloated 
from the effects of beer and the intense heat, increased 
by the pans of boiling fat in which potatoes were frying. 

Cheval bought a mirror for seventeen sous and a 
handkerchief for three francs, which he presented to 
Catherine. At every turn they met old Moque and 
Bonneniort, who had come to the fete, silenlty walking 
side by side w ith swollen limbs. But one experience 
made them indignant; they saw Jeanliu inciting Bebert 
and Lydie to steal some bottles of gin from a little 
shop. Catherine boxed her brother^s ears, but the 
little one had already run off with a bottle. These ter- 
rible childeren would end in prison. When before the 
saloon called " La tète coupée, '^ Cheval insisted on the 
girls entering to watch a "concours de pinsons," which 
had been announced to take place there. 

Some Marchiennes nailmakers had brought a dozen 
little cages in which the blind finches remained motion- 
tionless, after being hung on a fence in the tavern 
yard. The idea was to see which one would sing the most 
in an hour. Each nadmaker, holding a slate, stood before 
his cage marking, and watching both his neighboi"'s 
cage and his own. The birds were started, the " Chi- 
choneaux," with its rich song, the " batisecouics," with 
its sharp ringing. At first all were timed, only risking 
occasional notes; then, little by little, becoming excited, 
their voices swelled out until finally they were carried 
away with such a spirit of emulation that they fell 
back and expired. The men screamed to them to sing 
more, more, more; while the spectators, about a hun- 
dred persons, remained silent amid the furious music 
of a hundred and twenty finches, all repeating the 
same thrills. A " batisecouics " gained the first prize, 
a coffee-pot. 

While Cheval and Catherine were there they saw 
Zacharie and Philomêne enter. After shaking hands 
they remained together. Suddenly Zacharie became 
angry at seeing a nail-maker pinch Catherine. She, 
blushing, made him be silent, fearing an attack from all 
the nail-makers, who would throw themselves upon 
Cheval and her brother. Her lover only laughed, and 
all four leaving the place tlie affair seemed ended. But 
just as they entered le Piquette to drink a beer, the 



GERMINAL. 127 

man again appeared insolently taunting them. Then 
Zacharie, from devotion to his sister, turned upon the 
saucy fellow. 

'• That's mv sister, you pig! I'll make you respect 
her." 

Their friends threw themselves between them, while 
Cheval said very calmly: 

" Leave him alone. This is my business, anyhow. I 
don't care for him." 

Maheu, on arriving with his party, quieted Catherine 
and Philomene, who were already in tears. They were 
all laughing now; the nail-maker had disappeared, and 
CJieval, at home in that saloon, treated his friends to 
drinks. Etienne was compelled to touch glasses with 
Catherine. All drank together, the father, the daughter 
and her lover, the son and his mistress. Then Pierron 
treated and they were all happy, when Zacharie again 
became excited on perceiving his friend Moquet. 

" I want to speak to him. Here Cheval, take care of 
Philomêne. I'll be back in a minute." 

In his turn, Maheu paid for the drinks. After all, 
if his boy wanted to revenge his sister, it was not 
"wrong. But on seeing Moquet, Philomêne shook her 
head. Those two fools went off to the Yolcan. 

In the evening, tliis fête day ended with a ball at le 
Bon-Joj^eux, given by the widow Lisia, a strong woman 
of forty years, round as a barrel, but so fresh-looking 
that she still had six lovers, one for each day in the 
week and the whole six on Sunday, she said. She 
called all the miners her children, having poured out 
their beer for thirty years. Le Bon- Joyeux had two 
rooms : the bar, in which was a counter and some 
tables, on a level with the great ball room, and a great 
hall with a wooden dancing floor. Two garlands of 
paper flowers were stretched from one end of the ceil- 
ing to the other, united at the center by a bunch of the 
same design ; while hanging on the wall were some 
pictures in gilt frames : Saint Eloi, tutelar saint of the 
iron men ; Saint Barbe, patron of tlie miners, and oth- 
ers. The ceiling was so low that the three musicians, 
in their little gallery, were obliged to bend their heads. 
Coal oil lamps were hung at the. four corners of the 
room. 



128 GERMINAL. 

This Sunday they began dancing while the daylight 
was yet entering through the open windows. But at 
seven o'clock the rooms filled up. A storm was rising, 
blowing up great black clouds of dust, blinding the 
people and covering everything. Maheu, Etienne and 
Pierron entered and found there Cheval, who was danc- 
ing with Catherine, while Philoméne stood by all alone 
watching them. Neither Levaque nor Zacharie had re- 
turned. As there were no seats in the ball room, after 
each dance, Catherine seated herself at the table with 
her father. They called Philoméne, but she preferred 
to remain where she was. It began to grow dark. 
The three musicians were doing their best, but nothing 
was longer visible but the moving figures of the dancers. 
A shout welcomed the four lamps; suddenly all shone 
out upon the red and perspiring faces. Maheu, laugh- 
ing, pointed out to Etienne, Moquette, who was waltzing 
in tlie arms of big Wheeler. She had been obliged to 
take a beau. 

At eight o'clock la Maheu appeared with Estelle in 
lier arms, followed by the children, Alzire, Henri and 
Lenore. She had come straight there to find her hus- 
band without fear of being mistaken later on they 
would sup, no one was hungry now with their stomachs 
drenched with either coffee or beer. Other women had 
arrived, who smiled on seeing la Levaque enter accom- 
panied by Bouteloup who lead by the hand Achille and 
Desiree, the children of Philoméne. The two neigh- 
bors seemed on very good terms; on the road they had 
come to a decision. La Maheu had suddenly become 
resigned to the marriage of Zacharie, worried at losing 
the wages of her eldest, but vanquished by the right, 
which she no longer could deny. She tried to be cheer- 
ful, though she constantly asked herself how she would 
make the two ends meet. 

" Sit down, neighbor," said she, on going up to a 
table near where her husband was drinking with 
Etienne and Pierron. 

" My man is not with you, is he?" asked la Levaque. 

Pushing two tables together they all sat down, call- 
ing for a new round of drinks. On perceiving her 
mother and children, Philoméne came forward, accept- 
ing a chair. She seemed happy to learn they were to 



GERMINAL. 129 

marry her at last, and when they looked around for 
Zacharie she said in a low voice: 

'•' I'm waiting for him. He's not here." 

Maheu had exchanged a glance with his wife. So she 
had consented. He became serious, smoking in silence, 
like her, filled with anxiety for the days to come, and 
angered at the children who married, one after the 
other, leaving their parents in misery. 

The dancing was still going on; at the close of a 
quadrille, the ball-room was filled with a reddish dust, 
the walls shook, and the dancers came into the bar, 
covered with perspiration. 

" Say now," whispered la Levaqne in la Maheu's 
ear, "what was that you said about strangling Catherine, 
if she took a lover? " 

Cheval had led Catherine to the family table, and 
they both stood drinking behind the father. 

'• Bah !" replied la Maheu, with a resigned air; "we 
all talk that way. I suppose I'll love her, too." 

In the midst of all that noise, in a whisper, Maheu 
communicated to his wife an idea which had come to 
him. Why shouldn't they take a lodger ? Etienne, 
for instance. They liked him, and he was seeking a 
boarding place. They'd have room enough when 
Zacharie was married. And the money which they 
would lose on that side, they would regain in part on 
the other. La Maheu's face brightened ; that was a 
good idea, if it could be settled. She seemed saved 
from hunger another time, and her good spirits re- 
turned so quickly that she gave an order for a new 
round of drinks. 

Etienne, meanv/hile, was talking to Pierron of his 
saving fund — trying to obtain his promise to join when 
the association should be formed. 

"And, if we strike, you see how useful that would 
be. You're one of us, ain't you ? " 

Pierron raised his eyes, paling at the thought of 
compromising himself. He stammered : 

" I'll think over it. The best kind of aid for oneself 
is to behave properly." 

At that moment Maheu turned to Etienne and of- 
fered to take bim as a lodger. The young man ac- 
cepted. He was very desirous of living in the alley. 



130 GERMINAL. 

where he could see more of his comrades. Everything 
was arranged, la Maheu declaring they need only 
wait for the marriage of Zacharie. 

At last Zacherie, Levaque and Moquet arrived, bring- 
ing with them the odor of the Volcan, a smell of gin. 
They were very drunk, knocking each other's elbows 
and laughing as though at a huge joke. When he 
learned tliat they had at last consented to allow him to 
marry, Zacharie laughed so hard that he choked him- 
self. Having no more chairs, Bouteloup moved over to 
share his with Levaque, and the latter, glad to see the 
whole family there together, called for some more 
drinks. 

" We don't often have a good time," he said. 

They remained there for six hours. Women were 
constantly arriving to rejoin and lead away their hus- 
bands. The room was so crowded tliat they sat shoulder 
to shoulder. Laughter resounded in the oven-like heat, 
and the violent dancing shook the building. 

Some one told Pierron that his daugliter Lydie was 
lying asleep across the pavement — she had drunk her half 
of the stolen bottle of gin and was intoxicated. He was 
compelled to carry her home while Jeanlin and Bebert 
followed him at a distance, thinking it very fnnnv. 
That was the signal for departure. Maheu and Levaque 
decided to return to the alley, while old Bonnemort and 
bloque also left, in the same silence in which they had 
passed the evening. A thunder storm was coming on; 
it was very hot, though a faint breeze stirred the ripe 
wheat. La Pierronne had not returned home. Neither 
the Levaques nor Maheus relished their supper; the 
latter even went to sleep over the cold meat left from 
the morning, while Etienne led Cheval away to have 
one last drink at Easseneus'. 

"■ I'm with you," said Cheval, v/hen his comrade had 
explained the affair of the saving fund to him. " Give 
me your hand. You're a good one." 

Etienne was beginning to feel the effects of the beer. 
He cried : 

" Yes, for justice I'd give up everything, drink and 
girls too. There's only one tiling that makes me happy; 
it is that some day we'll get the best of the masters." 



GERMINAL. 131 



CHAPTER XIY. 

Toward the middle of August, after the marriage 
of Zacharie and when he could procure from the com- 
pany a house in the alley for Philomene and the chil- 
dren, Etienne installed himself with the Maheas and 
for the first time he experienced an uneasiness before 
Catherine. 

It was an intimacy of every moment, he replaced the 
eldest brother, sharing the bed with Jeanlin, in front 
of the one in which the large sister lay. On going to 
bed and on arising he was obliged to undress and dress 
before her, seeing her also take off and put on her 
clothing. She had that transparent whiteness of 
blondes; though her face and hands were already 
spoiled, her arras and neck were crossed by a line of 
sunburn like an amber collar. She was, however, never 
offended. If, in spite of himself, he was compelled to 
observe her movements, he avoided uttering any joke 
of a dangerous kind when she hurridly undressed and 
slipped into bed. The presence of her parents re- 
strained him from the expression of any sentiment 
either of friendship on the one hand or rancor on the 
other. Soon their life became commonplace, at the 
toilet, at the repast, and during work. The only mod- 
esty assumed by the family was in the daily wash which 
the young girl now proceeded to take alone in the room 
above, while the men one after the other performed 
their ablutions on the lower floor. 

At the end of the first month Etienne and Catherine 
no longer noticed each other. The former complained 
little of Jeanlin who held himself aloof from him. 
Alzire slept without a breath, while in the morning 
Lenore and Henri were always found with their arms 
entwined, just as they had lain down. In the dark 
house there was no sound save the snores of the mother 
and father, coming forth at regular intervals, like the 
blasts of a forge. In reality Etienne found that lie was. 
better off there than at Rasseneur's, the bed was not bad, 
they changed it every fortnight; the soup was better; 
he only suffered from a scitrcity of meat. But for 



132 GERMIN'AL. 

forty-five francs he could not expect to îiavê a rabbit at 
each meal. Ilis money helped the family, who man- 
aged to get along with but few debts, and they evinced 
much gratitude towards their lodger. His linen was 
washed and mended, his buttons sewed on, his clothing 
kept in order, and he appreciated the neatness of the 
family. It was at this time when Etienne had com- 
menced to understand the ideas which had filled his 
mind; up to this time he had only had the promptings 
of instinct amid the sullen actions of his comrades. He 
asked himself all sorts of confused questions: Why the 
misery of one? Why the wealth of others? Why this 
one under the control of that one, without the hope of 
ever changing places with him? His first lesson was 
to compreliend his ignorance; then a secret shame, a 
chagrin took possession of him; of the vigor of the 
laws he knew nothing; he no longer dared converse 
about the things which perplexed him, the equality of 
all men, the justice which formed a dividing line be- 
tween them and the aristocracy. So he applied himself 
to the study of political economy only to learn its de- 
fects. Now he kept up a regular corrcs2:)ondence with 
Pluchart, through whose instructions he was launched 
m the socialist movement. He sent for some books of 
which the reading badly digested, served to exalt his 
views. A book of medicine especially, VHygiéne du 
mineur, and a treatise on political economy of an in- 
comprehensible technical dryness, and some anarchist 
pamphlets, which only served to confuse him, in con- 
nection with a few old newspapers which he kept as a 
final resort to which he could refer for argument in 
any discussion that might arise. Jouvarine, however, 
took some volumes to him, and a work upon the co-oper- 
ative society had made him dream for a mouth of a uni- 
versal association of exchange, abolishing money, bas- 
ing upon work the entire social life. Shame of his 
ignorance was followed by pride; he was able to think 
for himself. 

.During these first months, Etienne was possessed 
with the ravishing delight peculiar to a neophyte, his 
heart nearly bursting with generous indignation against 
the oppressors. He had not yet made for himself a. 
system from the vagueness of his readings. The prac- 



GERMIÎ^AL. 133 

tical claims of Easseneur intermingled in him with the 
distracting violence of Jouvarine, and when he went 
out of l'Avantage, where he continued almost every 
day to rail against the company, he walked away in a 
sort of dream, assisting in the radical regeneration of 
the people without its costing a broken window or a 
drop of blood. Nevertheless the means of execution 
were ooscure; he preferred to believe that things would 
go very well for he lost his head as soon as he tried to 
form a programme of reconstruction. He occasionally 
repeated that it was necessary to banish the political for 
the social question, a phrase which he had read and 
which seemed wise to him to say among the phlegmatic 
coal men where he lived. 

Now, every evening at Maheu's, they were a half hour 
later in going to bed. Etienne always spoke of the 
same cause. Since his nature had become refined, he 
found himself more and more offended by the promis- 
cuousness of the alley. Were they beasts to be thus 
penned up one with the other in the midst of the fields; 
so crowded together that one could not change his 
clothing alone? 

"Confound it!" said Maheu; "if we had more 
money we would have more ease. All the same, it's not 
easy for people to live like this." 

The family took part in the talks, each speaking his 
mind while the oil from the lamp tainted the air of the 
room already smelling of fried onions. No, life was 
not funny. They worked like beasts at labor which 
was worse than a galley slave's, running the risk of be- 
ing killed and then not earning enough to have meat 
once a day. They were obliged to eat sparingly or be 
devoured by debts; and when Sunday arrived they 
spent the one day passed above ground in a sleep of 
fatigue. 

Now, la Maheu broke forth: 

"The foolishness is when they say it can change; 
that happiness will come some day. I don't wish ill of 
any one, but there are times when this injustice sickens 
me. 

They were silent. But when old Bonnemort was 
there he would open his eyes in amazement. In his 
time they did not trouble themselves in that manner; 



134 GERMINAL. 

they were born among the coal and dug the vein with- 
out demanding the why and wherefore; he now breathed 
an air which had filled the coal men with ambition. 

"A good drink's a good drink/' he murmured. 
''The chiefs are often scoundrels, tsut there'll always 
be chiefs, won't there? It's useless to break your own 
head in finding fault with theirs." 

Immediately Etienne became excited. That was 
just it. Things would change, because the workmen 
were thinking of these things. In olden times the 
miner lived like a brute, always under ground, like a 
machine for extracting the coal, ignorant of what was 
occurring outside of the mine. The owners who governed 
them understood each other. The seller and buyer 
could eat their flesh, and the coal men we're not even 
aware of it. But from this time on the miner was 
awake, and he would make himself felt as one of an 
army of men who would re-establish justice. Had not 
all citizens been equal since the revolution? They voted 
together. Why did the workingman remain the slave of 
the employer who paid him? At present the great com- 
panies with their machines wiped out everything. They 
no longer even had the guarantee of olden times. The 
men of the same trade must at least unite and defend 
themselves, and, thanks to instruction, there would he 
an explosion of everything one day. For, look in the 
alley even — the grandfathers would not have been able 
to sign their names as the fathers now signed, and the 
sons knew how to read and write like professors. The in- 
creasing knowledge pushed forward, little by little, a rude 
harvest of men ripening as under the sun. From this 
moment they no longer stuck, each in his place, through- 
out his entire existence, but they had the ambition to 
take the place of the next higher. Why, then, should 
they not use their fists in becoming stronger? 

Maheu, though disturbed, remained full of opposi- 
tion. 

"If you did anything, they'd give you back your 
livret," he said. "JSTo, the old folks are right; the 
miner'll always have to work with the hope of a leg of 
mutton, now and then, in recompense. That's fate, 
which nothing can change." 

La Maheu, who had been silent for some moments, 



GEKMIÎTAL. 135 

broke out, as if in a dream, murmuring in a low voice- 
" Still, if what the priests tell us is true, the poor 
people of this world will be rich in the other." 

A burst of laughter interrupted her. Even the chil- 
dren shrugged their shoulders. All were incredulous of 
this belief, having a secret fear of the mine's ghosts, but 
laughing at the empty sky. 

" Fool! " cried the father. " If the priests believed 
that, they'd eat less and work more, to keeja a good 
place on high for themselves. No; when we're dead, 
we're dead." 

The wife heaved great sighs. 

"Ah! mon Dieu! ah! mon Dieu!" 

Then both hands fell upon her knees, with an air of 
deep dejection. 

"Then it's true, we're fools." 

All turned, looking at Etienne. Bonnemort spat in 
the fire, while Maheu, his pipe out, watched his mouth. 
Alzire listened between Lenore and Henri asleep by the 
table. But Catherine, her chin in lîer hand, seemed to 
drink in with her great clear eyes, every word he uttered, 
as he spoke of his belief, opening the enchanted future 
of his social dream. Around them the alley was in 
darkness, nothing was heard but the cry of an infant 
or the quarrel of an obstinate drunkard. In the room 
the clock ticked softly. A moist freshness went up 
from the sandy hearth in spite of the heavy air. 

" And there are other thoughts," said the young 
man. " Do you need God and paradise to make you 
happy? Are you not able to make happiness for your- 
selves on earth? " 

With an ardent voice he spoke of the wasted years. 
From the closed horizon a ray of light had shone out at 
last, displaying itself in the somber life of these poor 
people. The constant misery, the overpowering work, 
the beast-like life, in the end slaughtered for others, 
would all disappear at a blow and justice would descend 
from the sky; that justice which would bring happiness 
to all men, making equality and fraternity reign su- 
preme. A new society would spring up in a day, with 
a wonderful country, where each citizen would live 
from work and take his part in the common 303% The 
old rotten world would fall in pieces; a young humanity, 



136 GERMINAL. 

purged of their crimes, would form a simple people of 
workingmen who would have for a motto " to each, 
merit according to his worth." That dream, constantly 
enlarged and embellished, became so enchanting as to 
rise higher than the impossible. 

At first la Maheu refused to listen, filled with an un- 
known terror. No, no, it was too good; they shouldn't 
have such ideas, for it made life seem still worse; and to 
be happy they would have to kill everyone above them. 
When she saw Maheu's eyes shine, troubled, conquered, 
she became still more excited, interrupting Etienne: 

''Don't listen, my man. You see he's telling us 
stories. Do you think the bosses would ever consent to 
work like us?" 

But little by little the charm also acted upon her. 
With imagination awakened, sighing, she entered into 
the enchanted world of hope. It was so sweet to forget 
the sad reality for an hour. When they lived like 
brutes with their noses in the ground, they needed to 
treat themselves to things which they could never pos- 
sess. But that which compelled her to agree with the 
young man was her sense of justice. 

"There you're right," cried she. " It would surely 
be just to possess in our turn." 

Then Maheu exclaimed: 

"Great God! I'm not rich, but I'd give a hundred 
sous not to die until I've seen all that. What a turning 
upside down. Do you think it'll be soon, and how are 
people to go about bringing it around? " 

Etienne again commenced to speak. The old society 
would break up; it could not last longer than a few 
months. He went into the work of execution more 
vaguely, mixing up what he had read, but not fearing 
before these ignorant people to launch out into expla- 
nations which even he did not understand. All the 
workings were smoothed down into a certainty of easy 
triumph, which would terminate the misunderstanding 
between the classes. The Maheus seemed to compre- 
hend, approving, accepting the most miraculous solu- 
tions with the blind faith of new believers, equal to 
those Christians in olden times who waited for the com- 
ing of a perfect society upon the ashes of the old. 
Alzire^ who understood part of this conversation, inj- 



GERMINAL. 137 

agined this happiness to be a very warm house, where 
the children played and ate all they wished. Cather- 
ine, without moving, her chin always in her hand, 
never took her eyes from Etienne, and when he became 
silent she paled and shivered as though with cold. 

But the mother looked at the clock. 

"It's after nine. We'll never be able to get up to- 
morrow." 

And they arose from the table in despair, their hearts 
ill at ease. It seemed to them they had been wealthy, 
and had now fallen back in the mire. Old Bonnemort 
started for work, growling that these stories didn't 
make the soup taste better, while the others went up to 
bed, more sensible to the damp but heavy air of the 
room. 

At these evening talks a few neighbors often came 
in to listen — Levaque, who was excited at the idea of 
sharing in sucli happiaess; Pierron, whom prudence 
sent off as soon as the company was attacked. Zachaire 
sometimes appeared; but politics wearied him. He pre- 
ferred to go down and take a drink at Kasseneur's. But 
Cheval, who had become the firm friend of Etienne, was 
more forcible, wishing blood. He passed an hour with 
the Maheus every evening, and an unavowed Jealousy 
had sprung up in him on seeing the attitude of Cather- 
ine while Etienne was speaking. He feared his com- 
rade had stolen his girl from him. That girl of whom 
he had soon tired, suddenly became very dear to him 
when she lived in the same house with another man. 

Thus Etienne's influence became enlarged. Little by 
little he revolutionized the whole alley, while he raised 
himself in the esteem of his friends. La Maheu, in 
sj)ite of her defiance in the beginning, treated him with 
the consideration due a young man who paid his board 
regularly, and who drank but little, spending all his 
spare time over a book. She started his popularity 
among the neighbors, giving him the reputation of a 
smart fellow, for which he was annoyed by being con- 
stantly asked to write their letters. He became a sort 
of man of affairs, charged with the correspondence, con- 
sulted by the house-wives, in all cases. So by the first 
of September he commenced his famous saving fund. 
Not counting on the alley alone, he wished to obtajij 



138 GERMINAL. 

the adhesion of the coal men in all the mines, find if 
the company remained passive he was confident of suc- 
cess. They appointed him secretary of the association, 
and he made some small sums by writing. That made 
him almost wealthy, for though a married man was not 
able to make both ends meet, he, a sober boy, was able 
to save a little. 

From the first, with Etienne, a slow transformation 
had taken place, some instincts of comfort, which had 
slept in his misery, now showed themselves. He bouglit 
a pair of fine boots, a cloth suit, and he became their 
chief at once. All the alley grouped around him. A 
feeling of self-satisfaction came over him, he became 
intoxicated with these first caresses of popularity; from 
being at their head, a commander, he dreamed of tlie 
next revolution in which he should play an important 
role. His face changed, he became grave, listening to 
himself talk; while his growing ambition led him into 
the most radical ideas. 

Meanwhile the autumn was advancing; the winds of 
October had ruined the little gardens of the alley, there 
only remained the winter vegetables, cabbage covered 
with white frost, leeks and onions. Again the storm 
beat upon the red tiles, running in torrents into the 
casks under the water-spouts. In each house the fire 
was kept up, rendering heavy the air of the small 
rooms. It was the commencement of another season 
of great misery. 

In October on one of the first cold nights, Etienne, 
feverish after a lengthy talk, could not sleep. He 
waited until Catherine had slipped into bed, then blew 
out the candle. She also appeared excited. In the 
darkness, she lay as if dead; but he knew well she was 
not sleeping; and he felt she was thinking of him just 
as he was of her. Never had their hearts gone out so 
toward each other. Twice he raised from the pillow 
thinking he would tell her of that love he bore for her, 
but shame for the time and jilace withheld him. Al- 
most an hour passed away, and they still lay with open 
eyes peering into the darkness asking themselves what 
was that barrier which kept them apart. 



GEKMINAL. 139 



CHAPTER XV. 

"LiSTEisr/' said la Maheu to her husband; **when 
you go to Montson for your pay, bring me a pound 
of coffee and a half pound of sugar." 

He was sewing up a rent in his shoe, to save having 
it mended. 

'' All right !" replied he, without turning from his 
work. 

" Stop at the butcher's, too ; I want a piece of veal. 
We haven't had any for a long while." 

This time his head was lifted. 

" You must think I'm going to get some thousands." 

It was Saturday, the twentieth of October, and the 
company, under the pretense of a break in the engine, 
had suspended work in the mine. For some time, fear- 
ing a panic, not wishing to increase their already heavy 
stock, they had been using every excuse to stop the 
labor of their ten thousand men. 

"You know Etienne's waiting for you at l'Avant- 
age," resumed la Maheu, after a few moments of 
silence. *' Go on ; he'll be mad if he has to wait for 
you." 

Maheu nodded his head. In the weariness of a day 
of enforced idleness, they had not breakfasted until 
noon, and the young man had gone to Easseneur im- 
mediately upon arising from the table, saying he would 
wait there for Maheu. The clock struck two. The 
wife continued : 

"You ought to hurry; and if those gentlemen are 
there, you must talk with them about your father. 
The doctor's wrong. He's able to work yet ; ain't you, 
father ? " 

For ten days old Bonnemort had been utterly help- 
less ; his limbs swollen twice their size. She was com- 
pelled to ask the question a second time. Then he 
growled : 

" Of course, I'll work. Because I have the rheuma- 
tism once in a while, is no reason why I should stop for 
good. They're trying to get out of giving me my 
pension of a hundred and sixty francs." 



140 GERMINAL. 

La Maheu was thinking of the forty sous earned by 
the old man, which he perhaps would no longer bring 
her, and she groaned with fear. 

"Mon Dieu! if this keej^s on, we'll all be dead soon." 

*' We won't be hungry when we're dead," said Maheu. 

He added a few nails to his shoes, and decided to set 
out, as he was to be paid that afternoon. All the men 
were starting from the alle}^, followed by their wives, 
who begged them to return at once. They had given 
them many commissions to prevent them spending the 
remainder of the day in the saloons. 

At Easseneur's, Etienne had learned some news. For 
a number of days, uneasy reports had been circulating. 
The company were growing more and more discontented 
with the propping. A conflict appeared sure, not only 
from that, but on account of other secret and grave 
causes. 

As Etienne arrived at the saloon, a miner who was 
taking a drink, on his return from Montson, was telling 
the men that a notice was posted up in the cashier's 
room. But he could not read, so did not know what it 
was about. Man after man entered, each bringing a 
different story. It seemed, nevertheless, that they had 
all come to a resolution — a revolt was springing up. 

"What do you say to it?" asked Etienne, sitting 
down to a table near Jouvarine, who, as usual, was 
smoking. The machinist went on with his cigarette. 

It was easy to see they were going to try harsh 
measures. He was the only one with intelligence 
enough to analyze the situation. He explained in his 
quaint manner that the company, fearing a panic, were 
forced to reduce their expenses if they cïid not wish to 
go under, and naturally it was the salaries of the work- 
men which they would cut down first, under some pre- 
tense or other. The coal was not selling, nearly all tlie 
manufactories stood still. This saving fund was mak- 
ing the company uneasy; it was a threat for the future. 
A strike would clear it away while the funds were still 
low, and consequently they were trying to bring on that 
strike. 

Easseneur had seated himself near Etienne, and both 
listened with an air of consternation. They were able 



GERMINAL. 141 

to Speak in a loud voice. No one was there now but 
Madam Rasseneur, who vvas leaning on the bar 

'• What an idea! " murmured the tavernkeeper. " The 
company can make nothing from a strike, or the workmen 
either. The best thing is to understand each other. ^* 

He was very wise, he always appeared reasonable. 
Ever since the growing popularity of his former lodger 
he had been exasperated at that system of rapid prog- 
ress, saying one would obtain nothing which they 
insisted upon hashing all at once. Though, with the 
good nature of a fat man usually full of beer, a growing 
jealousy was arising in him, which vv'as aggravated by 
the desertion of his saloon, where the workmen came 
less to drink and listen to him; and now he began pro- 
tecting the company, forgetting the hatred which he, 
as a discharged miner, had felt for them. 

''Then you're against the strike?" cried Madame 
Easseneur, witiiout leaving the bar. 

And when he had replied yes, she made him be silent. 

'''You have no heart, let these gentlemen talk." 

Etienne had been thinking with his eyes on the drink 
which had been served him. Finally he raised his head. 

"All that our comrade says is very possible, and it 
v/ill be necessary for us to strike if they force us to do, 
so. . . . Pluchart has written me some very wise 
things on that subject. He does not approve of the 
strike either, for the workman suffers from it as much 
as the owner, without gaining anything. Only he sees 
in this an excellent occasion to decide our men to join 
Ills company. Well! here's his letter.'* 

Pluchart, grieved at the distrust in which the 
Montson miners held the International, hoped to see 
them all adhere if a conflict with the company com- 
pelled them to strike. In spite of his efforts Etienne 
had only been able to obtain a few members, using his 
influence on behalf of the saving fund which was much 
better received. But that fund was still small; and the 
strikers must join the association, so that their brother 
Vr'orkmen all over the country would come to their aid. 

"How much have you in the fund?" asked Eas- 
seneur. 

"Scarcely three thousand francs!" replied Etienne. 
•^'You know the directors spoke to me of it the day 



142 GERMINAL. 

before yesterday. Oh! they were very polite, they told 
me they would not prevent the workmen from starting 
a saving fund; but I saw they wanted the control of it 
themselves. From the look of things I think we'll 
have to fight against them." 

The tavern-keeper walked up and down the room, 
with an air of contempt. Three thousand francs! 
What good would that be? It would not last six days, 
and if they counted on strangers, the people of England, 
they might as well lie down and die at once. No, that 
strike would be too stupid. 

Then for the first time, augry words were exchanged 
between these three men, who generally understood 
each other. 

"What do you think of it?^' said Etienne turning 
again to Jouvarine. 

He, without taking his cigarette from his mouth, 
answered in his usual disdainful manner: 

''Strikes? they're foolish." Then amid the angry 
silence which fell, he added slowly: 

" After all I don't say no, if that amuses you, it 
ruins one and kills the other, so that is always that 
much made. . . . Only in that way, it would take 
a thousand years to renew the world. Commence, there- 
fore, by blowing up with a barrel of powder that prison 
in which you are dying." 

With his little hand, he designated the Voreux, the 
buildings of which could be seen from the open door. 
But an unforeseen occurrence interrupted him. Pologne, 
the large rabbit who had ventured out of the door, was 
driven back by stones hurled by a number of boys; and 
in her fright, with drooping ears, and tail upraised, she 
took refuge between his legs, scratching him to be taken 
up. When he had lain her across his knees, sheltering 
her with both hands, he fell in that sort of dream into 
which the caress of that soft skin always plunged him. 

Just then Maheu entered. He did not wish a drink; 
in spite of the polite invitation of Madame Easseneur, 
who sold her beer as though she were giving it away. 
Etienne rose, and both men went off toward Montson. 

The fifteenth, on which the miners were paid, seemed 
like a fête day. A crowd of men were constantly leav- 
ing the alley. The cashier's room being very small, 



GERMINAL. 143 

they preferred to wait outside, and stood in groups on 
the pavement, blocking up the doorway from the line 
of men which was constantly increasing. Street vend- 
ers, thinking to profit by the occasion, placed along the 
road their bazaars, containing every conceivable thing 
from crockery to meat. But the saloons reaped the 
richest harvest, for the miners stood at the counters 
while waiting for their turn to be paid, and, after 
receiving their money, returned to settle for those 
drinks, and always ended by having some others. They 
were wise men who did not spend a greater part of their 
earnings before reaching home. 

Meanwhile, when Maheu and Etienne reached that 
crowd of men, they saw each one filled with a sullen 
exasperation, while hands were doubled up and violent 
words ran from mouth to mouth. 

''Is this true?" asked Maheu of Cheval, whom he 
met before the saloon Piquette. "Have they really 
done this dirty thing?" 

Cheval only replied with a low growl, casting a side- 
long glance upon Etienne. 

For some time a fierce jealousy of that comrade had 
been growing on him, he began to hate that new- 
comer who placed himself at their head, and who had 
become so popular in the alley. Ho had also quarreled 
with Catherine on his account, furious at the thought 
of her living in the house with that man. 

Maheu asked him another question : 

" Had the Voreux done what they threatened ? " 

And when he turned away, after having nodded his 
head, the two men decided to go on to the mine. 

The cashier's room was a little square office, sepa- 
rated by a grating. Upon benches along the walls, five 
or six miners were waiting ; while the cashier, assisted 
by an employe, was paying another man, who stood be- 
fore the door, cap in hand. Above the benches, on the 
left, a yellow placard was pasted, still clean on that 
dusty wall. Since early morning, a constant file of 
men had passed before it. Entering the room in 
groups of twos or threes, they stood there motionless 
for a second, then went away, shrugging their should- 
ers with a dejected air. 

Now, before the bill stood two men ; one young, with 



144 GERMINAL. 

a square, brute-like head, the other old, with a thin, 
aged face. Neither one could read, and while the boy 
slowly spelled out the words, his companion stood 
stupidly looking on. Many entered thus to look with- 
out comprehending. 

" Read that, will you ? " said Maheu to his friend. 
Even he was only able to spell it out letter by letter. 

Then Etienne began reading. It was a notice from 
the company to the coal men in all the mines. It noti- 
fied them that owing to the fear of beiug compelled to 
inflict heavy fines for their poor propping, it had resolved 
to begin a new manner of payment to the coal diggers. 
Henceforth it would pay in part for the timbering, so 
rûuch for every cubic metre of wood sent down and 
used. The price of the coal cars would naturally be 
cut down in proportion from fifty centimes to forty. 
And an obscure calculation was given to prove that the 
ten centimes lost on the cars was made up in the price 
paid for timbering. The company added that, wishing 
to give every one time to become convinced of the 
advantages presented by this new method, it had con- 
cluded not to put the plan into execution until Mon- 
day, the first of December. 

"Read lower there!" cried the cashier. "We can't 
hear our own ears." 

Etienne finished reading without noticing this obser- 
vation. His voice trembled, and when he had con- 
cluded they all still fixedly regarded the card. Then 
the old miner and young man left the room with bent 
shoulders. 

" Nom de Dieu! " murmured Maheu. 

He and his companion seated themselves. Thinking 
with heads bent, while the defile still continued before 
that yellow paper, they were calculating. Was the com- 
pany making game of them? They could never require 
from the timbering the ten centimes lost on the cars. 
At the most they could only reach eight centimes, and 
that left two of which they would be robbed, with 
counting the time they would lose in propping carefully. 
They had cut down their salaries in this disguised man- 
ner. The company economized by stealing from the 
miners. 



GERMINAL. 145 

" Nom de Dieu, de nom de Dieu ! " repeated Maheu, 
raising his head. " We're fools if we stand this." 

But the grated door opened, and he approached to be 
paid. The head miners alone presented themselves at 
the office. They received all the money earned by the 
men in their drift and afterward divided it among 
them. 

'^ Maheu and consorts!" he called, ''vein Felonnière! 
drift number seven! " 

The employe looked over the lists made by the over- 
seers each day from the board, on which the number of 
cars sent up were tallied. Then he repeated: 

'''Maheu and consorts! vein Felonnière! drift number 
seven! . . . One hundred and thirty-five francs." 

The cashier held out the money. 

" Pardon me," Monsieur, stammered Maheu in distress. 
"Haven't you made a mistake?" He looked at that 
small amount of money without touching it, shivering 
slightly. Of course he expected poor pay, but it could 
not be ?A little as that; they must have calculated 
wrong. When he would have given Zacharie his part 
and Etienne and the man who replaced Cheval, then 
he would only have fifty francs left to divide between 
his father, Catherine, Jeanlin and himself. 

" No, we have not made a mistake," replied the em- 
ploye. " We have deducted two Sundays and four days 
that there was no work; that leaves you only nine days 
to be paid for." 

Maheu followed the calculation, added up in a low 
tone: nine days would give him about thirty francs, 
eighteen to Catherine, nine to Jeanlin; as for old 
Bonnemort, he had worked but three days. No 
matter, by adding the seventy francs of Zacharie and 
the two other men, that would surely make more. 

" Don't forget the fines,'' said the employé. " Twenty 
francs for defective timbering." 

The digger made a gesture of despair. Twenty 
francs fine and four days laid off. When Zacharie was 
not keeping house and Bonnement worked he brought 
home a hundred and fifty francs every pay day. 

"Go on, take it," cried the cashier impatiently; 
"don't you see there are others waiting? If you don't 
want it, say so."

146 GERMINAL. 

When Maheu finally started to pick up the money 
with his great trembling hand the employé detained 
him. 

"Wait, I have your other name. Toussaint Maheu, 
is it not? Monsieur le Secretaire General desires to 
speak to you. Come in, he is alone.'' 

Astonished, the workman found himself in an office 
furnished in solid mahogany and faded green rep. And 
he listened for five minutes while the Secretaire General, 
a thin, pale man, spoke to him over the papers piled on 
his desk without raising his eyes. The buzzing in his 
ears prevented him from hearing. He vag'uely com- 
prehended that he was being questioned concerning his 
father, who was to be given the pension of a hundred 
and fifty francs, having been in service for forty years. 
Then the Secretaire's voice became harsh. He repri- 
manded him, accusing him of occupying himself with 
politics. An illusion was made to his lodger, also the 
saving fund; finally he advised him not to mix himself 
up in these afi:airs, he who was one of the best work- 
men in the mine. He wished to protest, but could 
only utter a few unconnected words, twisting his cap 
between his febrile fingers as he retired, stammering: 

"Certainly, Monsieur le Secretaire . . . You're 
right, Monsieur le Secretaire." 

Outside, when he had again joined Etienne, who was 
waiting for him, he broke out. 

" I'm a fool. I ought to have been able to say some- 
thing . . . Not enough money to buy bread, and 
abuse besides! Yes, they're down on you, he told me 
the alley had been poisoned. He says we must bend our 
backs and say thanks. He's right, it's the most wise. " 

Maheu was almost dead from rage and fear combined. 
Etienne was thinking with a gloomy air. Again they 
traversed the groups who barred the street. Anger 
was visible on all sides, the exasperation of a calm 
people, a sullen murmur constantly arose from that 
mass, accompanied by violent gestures. Men who could 
count had made a calculation, and the two centimes 
made by the company from the timbering, circulated, 
being clearly seen by the most dull men. But the 
greatest rage was that felt against the frequent shutting 
down of work and the fines. Even now they had not 



GERMIISTAL. 147 

enough to eat. What would become of them if they 
cut down their salaries still more? In the saloons, with 
throats parched from their anger, they left the most of 
the small sum received upon the bar. 

From Montson to the alley not one word was ex- 
changed between Malieu and Etienne. When the 
father entered, his wife, who was alone with the chil- 
dren, immediately saw he had not made the purchase. 

" Well, you're a nice one," said she. " Where's my 
coffee and sugar and meat ? A piece of veal wouldn't 
have ruined you." 

He made no reply, struggling against the emotion 
which had seized him. Then across the rough face of 
that man, hardened in the mine, passed a look of de- 
spair, followed by great tears falling in a warm rain. 
He was broken down in spirits, and, crying like a child, 
he threw his fifty francs upon the table. 

"■ Here ! he stammered ; here's what I bring you. 
It's for the work of all." 

La Maheu looked at Etienne, and seeing him silent 
and crushed, she also burst into tears. How were nine 
people to live on fifty francs for fifteen days ? Her 
eldest bad left them, the old man could no longer 
make use of his limbs — they would all starve. Alzire, 
seeing her mother weeping, threw herself on her neck, 
while Lenore, Henri and Estelle cried with all their 
might. 

And little by little, through the entire alley, the 
same cry of misery arose. Each house was lamenting 
that bad pay. Weeping women appeared at the doors 
as if their houses were not large enough to hold their 
anguish. A fine rain was falling, which they did not 
even feel, and calling from one door to the other, 
they held up the money received. 

" Look! this is all he has given me." 

" Look at me! I haven't enough to pay for the bread 
which we've used since last pay-day." 

La Maheu had gone out like the others. A knot 
of women was found around Levaque, who was crying 
the loudest. Her drunken husband had not even 
returned home, and she knew that, great or little, his 
pay was vanishing at the Volcan. Philomêne was wait- 
ing for Maheu, who had not yet given Zacharie his 



148 GERMINAL. 

money. La Pierrone alone was calm, while her mother 
stood among the most excited, shaking her fist toward 
Montson. 

"I saw your carriage go by this morning. Yes, you 
were sending your cook to Marchiennes for fish." 

The women became violent. That servant of the 
Hennebeaus driving by in his master's carriage made 
them indignant. Even though their workmen were 
dying of hunger, they must have fish. Perhaps they 
would not always have it. The people's turn would 
come some day. And these ideas, first sown by Etienne, 
sprouted forth in that cry of revolt. They were impa- 
tient for the age of promised gold, in haste to have a 
part of the happiness beyond that horizon of misery 
where they seemed shut up as in a tomb. The injustice 
was becoming so great; they would end by exacting 
their rights from those who had taken the bread from 
their mouths. The women were anxious to begin at 
once the foundation of that ideal city where miserable 
people would no longer live. It was almost dark; the 
rain was increasing when they left the alley to go back 
to their screaming children. 

That night at l'Avantage, they decided to strike. 
Even Rasseneur no longer fought against it, and Jou- 
varine accepted it as a first step. At once Etienne took 
in the situation; the company wanted a strike and it 
would have it. 



CHAPTER XVI. 



A VfEEK passed, work continued, while depressed and 
suspicious they waited for the conflict. 

At Maheu's one piece of bad luck followed another. 
Catherine ill from a terrible scene she had with Cheval, 
who was still jealous of her, was compelled to miss a 
day's work. A few days after, Jeanlin kept out of the 
mine for two days to play in the fields with Bebert and 
Lydie, without their knowing it. 

That morning as the men and girl were starting for 
work la Maheu raised herself up in bed and cried to 
Jeanlin: 



GERMINAL. 149 

'' I'll take the skin off of your back if you try that 
again." 

Work was very hard at Mahen's new drift. That 
part of the vein Felonniére tapered off so much that the 
miners, squatting between the wall and roof, rubbed the 
skin from their elbows while at work. On account of 
the dampness a flood of water was feared every moment, 
one of those sudden torrents which stave in the rocks 
and carry off the men. The day before, Etienne, after 
violently driving his pick into the rock and then with- 
drawing it had received a jet of water in his face; but 
that was only an alarm, which had made the drift still 
more damp and unhealthy. He no longer thought of 
possible accidents, passing the days there like his com- 
rades, unconscious of peril. They lived in the firedamp 
without even feeling its weight upon the eyelids. Cer- 
tain days, however, when the flame of the lamp paled 
and grew dim, their thoughts reverted to the danger, and 
a miner would put his ear to the vein, listening for the 
little sound of gas and air bubbles coming through the 
cracks. But the greatest danger was from a cave-in, 
owing to the insufficiency of the propping, which was 
always done too hurriedly; the ground, weakened by the 
water, did not hold and would suddenly fall in enormous 
masses. y 

Twice that day Maheu had been forced to strengthen 
the props. It had taken them two hours and a half. 
The men had gone back to their places in the drift, and 
Etienne had just finished the mining of a block, when 
a shock like a peal of thunder shook the whole mine. 

"What's that?" said he, throwing down his pick to 
listen. 

At first he thought their gallery was falling. 

But Maheu had already slipped through the opening 
to their drift, saying: 

"It's a cave-in! hurry, hurry!" 

All hurried off in fright. Their lamps flickered 
wildly in the death-like silence which had fallen. 
They ran in single file along the road with back bent, 
looking as if they were galloping on four paws, never 
slackening their pace. Where was it? in some drift 
perhaps. No, that sound came from below, in the car 
road. 



150 GEEMINAL. 

When they arrived at the narrow slit through which 
they were obliged to descend, they rolled down one 
upon the other without concerning themselves about 
the places which tore the skin from their bodies. 

Jeanlin, with back still red from the beating received 
from his mother the day before, had not made his escape 
from the mine that day. In his bare feet he was run- 
ning behind a train of cars to shut the ventilating doors, 
and at times, when he did not fear meeting an overseer, 
he jumped up and rode along on the last car, a thing 
which had been forbidden, fearing the boys would go to 
sleep there. Each time his train got out of the way to 
enable another to pass, he would run along in front to 
find Bebert, who led the horse. Running behind his 
friend he pinched him, looking like the mischievous 
ape which he was, with his curly hair, great ears, little 
thin nose and greenish eyes which shone in the dark- 
ness. 

In the afternoon these boys were given Bataille, whose 
turn for work had come, and when the horse snorted 
before an opening, Jeanlin, wiio was in front with 
Bebert, said to him: 

"What's the matter with the old coward? He'll 
make me break my legs yet. " 

But Bebert did not reply; he was compelled to hold 
the horse on one side at the ai^proach of another train. 
Bataille, from a distance, had recognized his old favor- 
ite Trompette, for whom he had been filled with a 
great tenderness ever since the day he had seen him dis- 
embark at the bottom of the mine. He had the affec- 
tionate pity of an old philosopher desirous of consoling 
a young friend, trying to teach him patience and resig- 
nation, for Trompette had not yet become accustomed 
to the mine. He wearily drew his car, still blind in 
that darkness, constantly regretting the sun. Thus 
each time Bataille met him he snorted and breathed 
upon his neck a caress of encouragement. 

When Trompette had passed, Bebert returned to the 
subject of Bataille. 

That old fellow's wise; when he stops like that, he 
scents a hole and he don't want to break his legs. I 
can't think what is the matter with him to-day at that 



GERMINAL. 151 

door. He pushes it and then keeps still. Is there 
anything wrong there? 

"No," said Jeanlin. "Only some water np to my 
knees." 

The train started off again. In the next trip, when 
he had pushed his head against the ventilating door. 
Bataille again refused to advance, snorting and trem- 
bling. At last after much coaxing he decided to resume 
his journey. 

Jeanlin, after again shutting the door, remained be- 
hind. With the aid of his lamp he perceived that the 
wood had given way from the constant oozing of a jet 
of water. Just then a miner, known through all the 
alleys by the nick name of Chicot, passed on the way 
to his drift. He also examined this spot, and as the boy 
darted forward to rejoin his train a cracking was heard, 
and a cave-in engulfed the man and child. 

A great silence followed. A thick dust was rising in 
the roads. Blinded and suffocated men were arriving 
from all parts, even the most distant drifts, while their 
flickering lamjis badly lit up that gallery filled with dark 
figures. When the first-comers ran against the cave-in, 
they cried out, calling their comrades. A second band 
of men from the lower drifts arrived at the other side 
of the mass which had fallen, blocking up the gallery. 
They soon found that the ceiling had given way upon 
ten metres at the most. The damage was nothing 
grave. But their hearts stopped beating as a death 
rattle came from the shadows. 

Bebert, leaving his tram, ran forward, calling: 

"Jeanlin is under there!" 

At that moment Maheu was arriving at the spot with 
Zacharie and Etienne. Filled with despair, he could 
only cry out: 

"My God! my God!" 

The women, who had also run forward, Catherine, 
Lydie and Moquette, began to sob, screaming with 
fright amid that terrible disorder which the darkness 
augmented. The men tried to silence them, but they 
became more hysterical at each rattle which came from 
the rocks. 

Richomme, the overseer, had arrived, in despair that 
neither M. Megrel nor Dansaert was in the mine. 



152 GEEMINAL. 

With ear pressed close to the ground he listened, and at 
last said the cries were not those of a child. A man 
was there. Then Maheu called Jeanlin. Not a breath 
came from the darkness. 

The little one must have been crushed at once. 

Then that death rattle again commenced. They spoke 
to the one in agony asking his name. The rattle alone 
responded. 

*'Make haste! make haste! "said Richomme, who had 
already gone to work. " They will die yet." 

From both sides the miners attacked the cave-in with 
their picks and shovels. Chevel, Maheu and Etienne 
worked side by side without a word ; while Zacharie 
directed the removal of the ground. The hour for 
ascending had come, no one had eaten ; but they would 
not leave while comrades were in peril. Meanwhile, 
thinking the people at home would be uneasy if they 
did not return, they^ spoke of sending ujd the women. 
But neither Catherine, Moquette, or even little Lydie, 
would move; they were riveted there by the wish to save, 
aiding the men in the excavation. Then Levaque ac- 
cepted the commission of announcing the cave-in, above. 
A simple damage which could be repaired. It was 
almost four o'clock; the workmen in less than an hour 
had done the work of a day. Half of the ground would 
already have been taken away had not a number of 
other rocks slid from the ceiling. Maheu, in a rage, 
refused with a weary gesture, when another approached 
to relieve him for an instant. 

" Gently," said Richomme, at last. " "We are coming 
to them. It will not be necessary to dig it all away." 

The rattle had become louder and louder as they dug 
down. It was this continual sound which guided the 
workmen, and now it seemed to move forth directly 
under the picks. Suddenly it ceased. 

Not a word was uttered. They all felt the chill of 
death pass by in the darkness. They dug with renewed 
strength, streaming with perspiration. A foot was en- 
countered; they attacked the earth with their hands 
now, disengaging the limbs one by one. The head was 
not crushed, Lamps were held down and the name of 
Chicot ran from mouth to mouth. He was still warm, 
the vertebral column broken by a rock. 



GEKMlîîAL. 153 

" Cover him up and put him on a car/* said the over- 
seer. "Now for the little one. Make haste ! " 

Malieu had not paused in his work. He gave a last , 
blow of the pick and an opening was made communi- l^ 
eating with the gang who were working on the other \ 

side. Those men cried out they had found Jeanlin, 
unconscious, both legs broken, but still breathing. The 
father took the little one up in his arms, crying between 
his teeth: ''My God! MyGod!'* Catherine and the 
other women again began to sob. 

They quickly organized the cortege. Bebert had 
brought back Bataille, whom they harnessed to the 
two cars ; in the first was the corpse of Chicot held up 
by Etienne, while in the second sat Maheu, holding 
on his knees Jeanlin, still unconscious, covered with a 
woolen cloth. On each car was hung a lamp, looking 
like a red star, Avhich was followed by fifty shadows 
walking in single file. Worn out, they dragged them- 
selves along, slipping in the mud, overcome by grief. 
It would take a half-hour to arrive at the foot of the 
shaft, and that funeral procession, under the ground, 
amid the blackness of night, went on through the 
winding galleries, turning and returning. 

At the shaft-room, Eichomme having sent on in 
advance, ordering an empty cage to be reserved, Pierron 
and three other loaders put the two cars on at once. In / 

one Maheu remained with his little injured one across / 
his knees, while in the other Etienne held in his arms / 
the corjDse of Chicot. Then when the workmen were j 
piled in the other stories, the cage ascended. The '' 
ascent took two minutes. The cold rain fell from the 
tubbing while these men were never so impatient to see 
the light of day. 

Happily, a boy sent after Dr. Vanderhaghen ha-i 
brought him back. Jeanlin and the dead man were 
carried into the overseer's room, where, in spite of the 
pleasant weather, a huge fire was burning. They threw 
two mattresses upon the hearth, laying the man on one 
and the child on the other. Maheu and Etienne 
entered alone. Outside, the women and men were 
grouped together, talking in a low voice. As soon as 
the physician glanced at Chicot, he murmured: 

"The devil! You can wash him." 



154 GERMINAL. 

Two overseers undressed and washed that corpse, 
bkck with coal, still dirty from the sweat of labor. 

" The head is all right/' resumed the doctor, kneel- 
ing before the mattress on which Jeanlin lay; " the 
chest sound. Ah! it is the legs which have suffered." 

He undressed the child with the skill of a nurse, and 
the poor little insect-like body appeared, covered with 
black dust and yellow earth which was marked with 
spots of blood. They must wash him also; the doctor 
conld see nothing. After the bath he seemed still more 
thin, with transparent skin through which they could 
see the bones. It was sad to see the degeneration of 
these miserable people who at one time or other were 
crushed by the falling rocks. When he was clean they 
saw the bruises on his white skin. 

Becoming conscious, he uttered a cry, while his 
father, with great tears streaming from his eyes, stood 
at the foot of tlie mattress wringing his hands. 

"You're his father, are you not?" said the doctor, 
raising his head. " Don't cry, try and help me. He's 
not dead yet." 

He found two simple ruptures. But the right leg 
made him uneasy. He feared it would have to be am- 
putated. 

At that moment the engineer, Négrel and Dansaert, 
came in with Eichomme. The first listened to the 
overseer's tale with an exasperated air. He flew into a 
passion. Always that bad i^ropping! had he not told 
them a hundred times that they would kill some one? 
a^r^ those brutes spoke of striking because they were 
forced to prop more solidly. The trouble was that the 
company would have to pay for the damage. M. Hen- 
nebeau would be furious. 

"Who is that?" said he to Dansaert, standing before 
the corpse, which they were about to cover with a sheet. 

" Chicot, one of our best workmen," replied the 
superintendent. "He has three children . . . 
Poor devil!" 

Meanwhile Doctor Vanderhaghen began talking to 
these gentlemen in a low voice. He said Jeanlin must 
be taken home immediately. Six o'clock struck. It 
was growing dark. It would also be well to get the 
corpse away. 



GEEMIJSTAL. 155 

The engineer gave orders that a wagon should be 
got ready at once. A litter was brought in and the 
injured child placed upon it, while they put into the 
wagon the mattress upon which at last rested the dead. 

When the door opened, a silence fell vipon the crowd 
waiting outside. A new cortege was formed, the cart 
before, the litter behind, and the people bringing up the 
rear. Leaving the mine they slowly wound up the road 
to the alley. The first winds of November were sweep- 
ing over the immense plain which night was slowly 
enveloping like a shroud falling from the livid sky. 

Etienne advised Maheu to send Catherine on ahead 
to break the news to her mother. The father, who 
followed the litter, completely worn out, consented with 
a nod, and the young girl ran off, for they were nearly 
there. But they must have been perceived already. 
Women, half crazy, ran from their doors. Very soon 
there were thirty, then fifty, all filled with the same 
terror. That wagon held a corpse. Who was it? 
Levaque having assured them that no one was hurt, 
only made them feel the greater shock. They thought 
it was not only one man who had perished, but ten, and 
that cart was going to bring them home one by one. 

Catherine found her mother terribly excited, and as 
soon as the first words were uttered, she cried: 

*'The father's dead!" 

In vain the young girl protested, telling her of Jean- 
lin. The woman flew to the door, and on seeing the 
wagon stop near the church, she nearly fainted away. 
At each door women dumb with fright looked on, while 
others followed the cortege to know where the cart and 
litter would stop. 

Then la Maheu saw the litter, behind which walked 
her husband. And when it was set down before her 
door, when she saw Jeanlin alive, though with both 
legs broken, there came such a sudden reaction that she 
was filled with anger, crying out, without a tear: 

"Thafs it, is it? They cripple our children now! 
. . . What can I do to them?" 

''Hush!" said the doctor, who had followed to dress 
the wounds. " Would you rather he had been killed? " 

The woman became more and more angry amid the 
tears of Alzire and the little ones, and while waiting on 



156 GERMINAL. 

the doctor she abused the lot, asking where they 
thought she could find money to support cripples. It 
was not enough with the old one, but now this rascal 
had lost his feet; and she never paused a moment while 
the others cried. Weeping and wailing was heard 
coming from a neighboring house, — the wife and chil- 
dren of Chicot crying over the body. It was a dark 
night. The men, still excited, were at last eating their 
soup. The alley had become silent, save of those piti- 
ful cries. 

Three weeks passed. They had been able to save the 
limb, but the poor child would always limp. The com- 
pany had given them fifty francs and had promised to 
give the little one some easy employment as soon as he 
recovered. It was but an increase of misery, for the 
father liad received such a shock that he had fallen ill 
with a heavy fever. 

On Thursday, Maheu had returned to the mine, and 
this was Saturday. That night, Etienne spoke for a 
long time of the first of December, which was close at 
hand, anxious to see if the company would carry out 
its threat. They waited up until ten o'clock for Cath- 
erine, who was out with Cheval. But she did not enter. 
At last la Maheu in anger bolted the door and they 
all ascended the stairs. Etienne was a long time in 
going to sleep, uneasy at that empty bed where Alzire 
took up so little room. 

The young girl did not return the next day, and the 
day following on his return from the mine Maheu heard 
that Cheval would not allow his daughter to come home. 
They had been having terrible quarrels, and to avoid 
reproach shf» had decided to go and live with him. He 
had left the Voreux and was now working at the Jean- 
Bart, the mine belonging to M. Deneulin, taking her 
with him as wheeler. They were living at la Piquette 
in Montson. 

At first Maheu spoke of going to knock the man 
down and bring his girl home. Then he became re- 
signed. What good would it do? It was bound to 
happen sooner or later. But la Maheu did not take 
the thing so easy. 

" Did I beat her when she went out with that Cheval?" 
cried she to Etienne, who listened in silence, though 



GERMINAL. 167 

very pale. " Tell me; youVe a reasonable man. We've 
left her free, haven't we? I was young when my man 
married me, but I didn't leave my parents as young as 
her to work for a man who had no need of the money. 
Ah! it's disgusting." 

And when Etienne only replied by nods of the head 
she resumed: 

"A girl who went where she had a mind. What's 
the matter with her? Why couldn't she wait until I 
married her? We've been too good; we ought to have 
kept her in the house without letting her have a beau. 
That's always the way — give them an inch and they'll 
take a mile." 

Alzire nodded her head, while Lenore and Henri, 
frightened at that sudden burst of anger, were sobbing 
very quietly. La Maheu now enumerated their bad 
luck. First Zacharie's marriage; then the old man 
helpless from rheumatism; after that Jeanlin's accident; 
who would not be able to leave his room for ten days 
yet; and now that goose of a Catherine had gone off 
and left them. The family was broken up. No one 
remained at the mine but the father. How were they 
going to live? Seven people without counting Estelle. 
They had better all go and throw themselves in the 
canal." 

" It don't do any good to fret about it," said Maheu, 
in a harsh voice. " We're not at the end yet, perhaps." 

Etienne, who was fixedly regarding the hearth, raised 
his head, murmuring, with eyes lost in a vision of the 
future : 

"Ah ! it's time, it's time !" 



CHAPTEE XVII. 



That Monday the Gregoires, with their daughter 
Cécile, were to lunch with the Hennebeaus. After 
leaving the table, Paul Megrel had intended taking the 
ladies to visit the Saint-Thomas, a newly fitted up mine; 
although this visit was merely a pretense of Mme. 
Hennebeau's to hasten the marriage of Paul and Cé- 
cile. . 



158 GERMINAL. 

That same Monday, at four o'clock in the morning, 
the strike had begun. On the first of December, when 
the company had put into execution its new system of 
salary, the miners had remained calm. At the end of 
fifteen days, on pay day, no one had made the least op- 
position. Every one, from the director to the over- 
seer, thought the tariff had been accepted, and the 
surprise was great that morning, before the declaration 
of war, which seemed so general and in such perfect 
control that it indicated an energetic director. 

At five o'clock Dansaert woke M. Hennebeau, inform- 
ing him that not one man had gone down in the 
Voreux. In the alley of the Deux-Cent-Quarante, 
which he had passed, every one was sleeping with 
windows and doors closed. As soon as the director had 
leaped from his bed, his eyes half closed with sleep, he 
was overwhelmed with business — messengers running, 
dispatches falling on his bureau as thick as hail. At 
first he hoped that the revolt had limited itself to the 
Voreux. But the news became more serious each mo- 
ment : It had extended to Crevecœur, Mirou, la Made- 
leine, where only the stable-men had appeared, the 
A^'ictorie and Feutry-Cantel — the two best disciplined 
mines, where only a third of the workmen had de- 
scended ; Saint-Thomas alone was all right, and seemed 
to keep out of the movement. Until nine o'clock he 
dictated dispatches, telegrajohing on all sides, to the 
prefect at Lille, to the companies' Managers, informing 
the authorities, asking for orders. He sent Megrel to 
make a tour of the neighboring mines and gain some 
precise information. 

All at once, M. Hennebeau thought of the breakfast, 
and he was going to send the coachman to inform the 
Gregoires that the affair was postponed, when he sud- 
denly thought of his wife. He ascended to Mme. 
Hennebeau's apartments, where a maid was dressing 
her hair. 

" So they have struck," said she quietly, when he had 
told her, " Well ! what difference does that make to 
us ? We are not compelled to stop eating, are we ? " 

She became stubborn when he told her the breakfast 
could not take place and the visit to Saint-Thomas must 
be put off. She found an answer to all. Why lose a 



GERMINAL. 159 

breakfast already on the fire? and as for the visit to the 
mine, they could give it up afterward, if it was found to 
be imprudent. 

" Moreover," she resumed when the maid had left the 
room, ''you know why I am anxious to see those good 
people. You ought to take more interest in that mar- 
riage than the stupidities of your workmen. Besides, 
I want it, so do not contradict me." 

He looked at her in silence, and over his hard face 
passed the secret pain of a bruised heart. Then he 
moved toward the door. 

" Very well," said he; " we will not countermand 
anything." 

M. llennebeau was born in the Ardennes. He had 
the difficult beginning of a poor boy thrown an orphan 
in the streets of Paris. After having slowly gone 
through the courses of a miners' school, he had, at 
twenty-four, started for Grand' Combe, as engineer of 
the mine Sainte-Barbe. 

Three years later he became a divisionary engineer 
at Pas-de-Calais, in the mines of Warles; and it was 
there that he married the daughter of a rich mine owner 
of Arras. For fifteen years the couple lived in the same 
little provincial town, without an event to break the 
monotony of their life, not even the birth of a child. 
A growing irritation came upon Mme. Hennebeau, who, 
brought up to respect money, held a great disdain for 
that husband who had but an ordinary salary, from 
which she could not derive the luxury wished for. He, 
a strictly honest man, would not speculate, keeping at 
his station like a soldier The coldness had begun 
from this, and was aggravated by one of those singular 
misunderstandings which so often come between those 
who are tied to each other. Then, she having become 
entangled in a love affair, he decided to leave Pas-de- 
Calais and go to Paris, thinking she would be grateful 
to him. But Paris had finished the separation; that 
Paris of which she had dreamed since her first ball, and 
where she had become accustomed in eight days to 
fashionable life, throwing herself into all the foolish 
luxuries of the time. The ten years that she passed 
there were filled with a great passion, a public liaison. 
That time the husband could not pretend ignorance. 



160 GERMINAL. 

but he was forced, after numerous quarrels, to become 
resigned, disarmed by the quiet unconsciousness of that 
woman who took happiness where she found it. It was 
after the rupture, when he had seen her sick with 
chagrin, that he accepted the directorship of the Mont- 
son mines, hoping when down in that desert of black 
countries he could teach her to do right. 

In the three years that they had lived in Montson, 
she fell back mto the irritable weariness of the first 
years of their married life. At first, she appeared 
solaced by that great calm, soothed by the flat monotony 
of that immense plain; and she settled down like a 
worn-out woman; she affected to have a dead heart — so 
detached from all, that she did not even worry over her 
increasing flesh. Then under that indifference a fever 
declared itself, a wish to live again, that she amused 
herself for six months by furnishing to her taste the 
little house in which they lived. She declared it odious; 
she filled it with tapestry, ornaments, and all the luxury 
of art, until it was the most beautiful place between 
there and Lille. Now the country exasperated her, 
those endless beet-fields and eternal black roads with no 
shade of tree, swarming with a frightful population 
which disgusted and frightened her. The cries of the 
exile were commencing. She accused her husband of 
having sacrificed her for the appointment of forty 
thousand francs, which was scarcely enough to keep 
house on. Why did he not imitate others, demand a 
part, and finally succeed in something? and she insisted 
with the cruelty of a woman who has brought her hus- 
band a fortune. He always took refuge in a cold de- 
meanor, through which the suffering of a tender nature 
dying in silence occasionally shone out. At the end of 
six months, when the house was all furnished and occu- 
pied no more of Mme. Hennebeau's time, she again fell 
into a great weariness, from which she would have been 
glad to escape by death. 

At that time Paul Megrel arrived at Montson. His 
mother, the widow of a captain, living at Avignon, 
having a small income, had lived on bread and water to 
educate him at the polytechnical school, from which he 
had gone forth poorly ranked, and his uncle, M. Henne- 
beau, offered him the position of engineer at the 



GERMINAL. 161 

Vorenx. From that time forward he was treated as one 
of the family, and as he lived with his uncle he was 
able to send his mother half of his salary of three thou- 
sand francs. To disguise that beneficence, M. Henne- 
beau pretended he needed the small house set apart for 
the engineer of the Vorenx, and also said it would have 
been too lonely for the young man to live there all 
alone. Mme. Hennebeau took the part of an aunt 
toward him, looking after his personal comforts. The 
first months she was quite motherly, always ready with 
advice on every subject. That intelligent boy amused 
her, and she at once looked about for a wealthy girl to 
whom she could marry him. 

Two years had gone by, when one day Mme. Henne- 
beau told her husband she had settled upon Cécile Gré- 
goire as the wife for their nephew. 

When he had descended from his wife's rooms, M. 
Hennebeau encountered Paul in the vestibule. The 
latter seemed to be enlivened by the strike; his eyes were 
bright, his voice loud. 

"Well?" said his uncle. 

" I've gone through all the alleys. They seem very 
quiet. They wish to send you some delegates. '' 

At that moment Mme. Hennebeau called from the 
head of the stairs: 

" Is that you, Paul? Come up and tell me the news. 
These men who are so happy are crazy to make beggars 
of themselves." 

And the husband was forced to wait to learn more 
until the young man had told his story to Mme. 
Hennebeau; and, returning to his office, he sat down 
before a desk on which a pile of telegrams was already 
collected. 

At eleven o'clock, when the Gregoires arrived, they 
were astonished to see the valet de chambre, on admit- 
ting them, cast uneasy glances up and down the road. 
The curtains in the salon were drawn tight, and they 
were immediately shown into M. Hennebeau's office, 
who excused himself from receiving them in this man- 
ner; but the salon opened upon the street, and it was 
useless to provoke the people more. 

''Have you not heard?" said he, seeing them sur- 
prised. 



162 GEEMINAL. 

When M. Grégoire learned that the strike had broken 
out at last, he shrugged his shoulders with a placid air. 
Bah! that would be nothing. With a nod, Mme. 
Grégoire approved of what her husband had said, while 
Cécile, very gay, looking quite pretty in a toilet of blue 
cloth, smiled at the word strike, which to her only 
meant a distribution of alms in the alley. 

But Mme. Hennebeau appeared, dressed in black silk 
and followed by Megrel. 

"Well, is not this tiresome! " cried she from the 
door. ''These men might have ex2)ected it, though. 
Do you know that Paul refuses to take us to Saint- 
Thomas?" 

"We can remain here," said M. Grégoire, obligingly. 
" That will be just as pleasant.'' 

Paul shook hands with Cécile and her mother. 

When Mme. Hennebeau heard the two young people 
laughing together, she threw on them a maternal glance. 

Meanwhile M. Hennebeau had finished reading some 
dispatches, and was writing the replies. They were all 
talking around him; his wife was explaining that she 
had done nothing to that work-room, which had kept 
its old red pajaer, its heavy mahogany furniture scratched 
by use. 

Three-quarters of an hour passed; they were just go- 
ing in to sit down to the table when M. Deneulin was 
announced. The latter entered quickly, in great 
excitement, and bowed before Mme. Hennebeau. 

"Why ! Are you here ?" said he, on perceiving the 
Gregoires. Then he began talking with the director. 

"They have done it, have they ? My engineer told 
me of it this morning. My people all descended this 
morning. But you know the strike may extend. I 
am uneasy. I want to know what you think of it ? " 

His tongue ran as fast as a horse, his uneasiness be- 
traying itself in the high tone of voice and commanding 
gestures, which made him resemble a retired cavalry 
officer. 

M. Hennebeau commenced to lay before him the 
exact situation, when the valet de chambre opened the 
dining-room door. 

"Stay and lunch with us," said the director. "1 
will finish telling of it at the desert." 



GERMINAL. 163 

''Yes, if it will please you/' replied Deneulin, so full 
of the affair that he accepted the invitation without 
other form. 

But, conscious of his impoliteness, he turned toward 
Mme. Hennebeau with an apology. She, however, 
was charming, and ordering a seventh cover she seated 
her guests. Mme. Grégoire and Cécile at each side of 
her husband, M. Grégoire and M. Deneulin at her right 
and left, and Paul between the'youug girl and her father. 
Then, when the first course was served, she resumed 
with a smile: 

" You will excuse me. I wanted to have some oysters. 
You know they arrive at Marchiennes on Mondays. 
I irroposed that my cook should take tlie carriage and 
go for some, but he was afraid of being stoned." 

They all laughed, thinking that funny. 

"Dear me!" said M. Hennebeau, looking at the win- 
dows from which they could see the road. " It is use- 
less to make known to the whole country that we have 
guests this morning." 

" I hope, however, they will allow us to lunch," said 
M. Grégoire. 

Laughs again broke forth. Every guest was at his 
ease in that room full of flaming tapestries and furnished 
Avith carved oak. Pieces of silverware shone on the 
buffet, while around the room were numbers of palm 
trees in majolica pots. It was a freezing cold Decem- 
ber day, over which swept a piercing wind from the 
northeast. But not a breath entered this warm house, 
throughout which was the delicate odor of burning 
pine. 

"Suppose we close the curtains," said Mégrel, who 
was amused at the thought of frightening the Gregoires. 

The maid was called and sent to fasten them. Then 
one joke followed another: they would no longer put 
down a glass or fork without the greatest precaution; 
they saluted each plate like a waif escaped from the 
pillaging of a conquered city; but behind that forced 
gaity was a secret fear which betrayed itself in involun- 
tary glances thrown towards the road as if a band of 
people, dying of hunger, watched the table from the 
outside. 

After the poached eggs and truffles, came some brook 



164 GERMINAL. 

trout. The conversation had fallen upon the industrial 
crisis which had been increasing for eighteen months. 

"The prosperity of the former years was too great," 
said Deneulin. ** Think of the enormous capital mo- 
tionless, of the railroads, the posts, the canals ; of all 
the money sunk in most foolish speculations. Look 
here with us, at the sugar manufactories, built here, as 
if the beet fields would give three crops. And to-day 
money is scarce, and it will be necessary to wait until 
they recover the interest on the millions put out. This 
is what has caused the stagnation in business." 

M. Hennebeau contended against that theory ; but 
he was obliged to admit that the prosperous years had 
corrupted the workmen. 

"Just think," cried he, "those people in our mines 
made as much as six francs a day ; just double what 
they earn at present. And they lived well — almost 
luxuriously. . . . To-day, naturally it seems hard 
to return to their old frugality." 

"Monsieur Grégoire," interrupted Madame Henne- 
beau, " I beg you take a few more trout. . . . They 
are delicious, are they not?" 

The director continued. 

"But I ask you, is that our fault? We are cruelly 
wronged also. Since the shops shut up one after the 
other we have had the deviFs luck to get rid of our 
stock, and in the face of all this we are forced to cut 
down everywhere. But the workmen will not compre- 
hend." 

Silence fell. One servant was bringing in some roast 
partridges, while another poured out the chambertin. 

" There is a famine in India," resumed Deneulin, in 
a low voice, as though talking to himself. "America, 
in stopping its orders for iron and brass, has given a 
heavy blow to our furnaces ; a shock heavy enough to 
shake the world. And the empire was so proud of that 
industry." 

He attacked a piece of partridge. Then, raising his 
voice : 

" The worst of it is that, to lower expenses, it would 
be necessary to produce more ; otherwise the blow will 
fall upon the salaries, and the workman is right when 
he says that he pays for the broken pitchers." 



GERMINAL. 165 

That acknowledgment raised a discussion. The 
ladies were not interested. Each one, however, occu- 
pied herself with the plate before her. As the servant 
entered, he seemed to wish to speak ; then he hesitated. 

''What is the matter ?" asked M. Hennebeau. "If 
you have any dispatches, give them to me. ... I 
expect some answers." 

" No, monsieur ; M. Dansaert is here. . . . But 
he fears to disturb you." 

The director excused himself, and called the super- 
intendent in. The latter remained standing a few feet 
from the table, while they all turned to look at the 
enormous man, out of breath with the news which he 
had hastened to bring. The alleys were quiet, but it 
was decided that a delegation should wait on M. Hen- 
nebeau. Perhaps is would be there in a few minutes. 

"Very well; thank you," said M. Hennebeau. "I 
wish a morning and evening report from you, do you 
understand?" 

And, when Dansaert was gone, the laughter com- 
menced again; they flew at the Eussian salad, declaring 
that if they wished to finish it they must hasten them- 
selves. The fun was increased when Megrel asked the 
servant for some bread and she replied, "Yes, 
monsieur" in so low and terrified a voice that she must 
have thought she had behind her a troop ready for 
slaughter. 

"You can talk," said Mme. Hennebeau compla- 
cently. "They are not here yet." 

The director, who had just been handed a bundle of 
letters and telegrams, wished to read one of the letters 
aloud. It was from Pierron, where in respectful 
sentences he informed them he was forced to strike 
with his comrades to save being badly treated, and he 
added that he was obliged to be one of the delegation, 
though he was against that step. 

"Well, he is a good one," cried M. Hennebeau. 

Then returning to the strike, they asked his opinion: 

"Oh!" answered he, "this is not the first one. 
It will be like all the rest, end after fifteen days of 
idleness. They will roam around the saloons; then 
when they are too hungry will return to the mine. 



166 GERMINAL. 

Deneulin shook his head, saying: 

'* I am not so easy this time, they appear better or- 
ganized. Have they not a saving fund?" 

" Yes, scarcely three thousand francs; what can they 
do with that? I suspect a man named Etienne of being 
their chief. He is a good workman; I shall be pro- 
voked if I am obliged to discharge him as I did the 
famous Easseneur, who still continues to poison the 
Voreux with his ideas and his beer. In eight days half 
of the men will descend, and in fifteen the ten thousand 
will all be at the bottom." 

He was convinced, though keeping an unavowed 
fear before the calm and discipline of the miners. His 
greatest uneasiness came from the possible disgrace 
which would fall on him if the owners held him re- 
sponsible for the strike. For some time he had felt 
himself less in favor. And putting back on his plate 
the spoonful of Russian salad he had taken up, he 
re-read the replies he had received from Paris, each 
word of which he tried to weigh. They excused him, 
the repast had turned into a military lunch, taken upon 
the field of battle, before the first shot. 

Then the ladies took part in the conversation. 
Madame Grégoire pitied those poor people who would 
starve of hunger, while Cécile already thought of carry- 
ing bread to them. But Madame Hennebeau became 
angry at any one speaking of the misery of the coal 
men of Montson. Were they not happy? Lodged, 
warmed and cared for at the expense of the company? 
In her indifference for those people, she had forgotten 
all save the lesson learned to astonish the Parisans who 
visited her. And she had at last come to believe her 
own tales; she was indignant at the ingratitude of the 
people. 

Megrel was still trying to frighten M. Grégoire. 
Cécile did not displease him, and to satisfy his aunt he 
wished to marry her; but that experienced boy had no 
love for the young girl. He pretended to be a repub- 
lican, although that did not prevent him from ruling his 
workmen with the most extreme rigor. 

"I do not think with my uncle, '^ he resumed. **I 
fear some grave ending to this. . . . So, Monsieur 



GEKMISTAL. 167 

Grégoire, I -warn you to watch your house. They may 
try to rob you.'* 

Just then, with a smiling face, M. Grégoire was 
speaking of the miners in a fatherly tone. 

" To rob me,'' cried he in amazement. '' And why to 
rob me?" 

''Are not you a stockholder of Montson? You do 
nothing. You live from the work of others. Thus, 
you are the chief, and that is sufficient. . . . Be- 
lieve me, if the social revolution was to triumph, it 
would compel you to return your fortune as stolen 
money." 

Suddenly he lost that child-like calmness, the uncon- 
scious serenity of manner. He stammered. 

"Stolen money, my fortune! Did not my great- 
grandfather work hard for the first sum put in the mine? 
Have we not run all the risks of the enterprise? Do I 
make a bad use of the income?" 

Madame Hennebeau, alarmed at seeing the mother 
and daughter also filled with fear, hastened to inter- 
fere, saying : 

" Paul is only joking." 

But M. Grégoire was beside himself . When the serv- 
ant passed a dish of crawfish he took three, without 
knowing what he was doing, and began to eat them. 

"Ah! I do not say there are no stockholders who 
abuse their fortunes. For example, I have been told 
that some ministers have received some of the Montson 
stock for services rendered to the company. That is 
like a great nobleman, whom I shall not name, a duke, 
and one of our heaviest holders of stock, whose life is a 
scandal of prodigality. . . . But we who live 
quietly, like the good people which we are, we who 
never speculate, who content ourselves with living com- 
fortably on that which we have and giving a part to the 
poor. . . . Why, your workmen would be robbers 
to steal from us." 

Megrel tried to calm him while still laughing at his 
rage. The crawfish were still passing into his mouth 
while one could hear the shells crack. The conversa- 
tion settled back on politics. In spite of all, still trem- 
bling, M. Grégoire said he was liberal ; and he regretted 
Louis- Philippe. As for Deneulin, he was for a strong 



168 GERMINAL. 

government ; he declared that the emperor slipped on 
the inclination of the lamented concessions. 

*'Do you remember '89/' said he. "It was the nobil- 
ity who rendered the revolution possible by its complic- 
ity, by its taste for philosophic novelties. . . . 
Well! the aristocracy of to-day are playing the same 
foolish game, with its madness for liberalism, its rage 
for destruction, its flatteries of the peojole. . . . 
Yes, yes, you sharpen the monster's teeth so that he can 
eat us up. And he will eat us, too." 

The ladies made him be silent, and changed the con- 
versation by asking him about his daughters. He 
spoke of them : Lacie was at Marchiennes, where she 
was singing with a friend ; Jeanne had commenced the 
head of an old beggar. But he spoke of these things 
with an absent air ; he had not taken his eyes from the 
director, who, absorbed in the reading of his tele- 
grams, had forgotten his guests. Behind those thin 
leaves he seemed to perceive Paris — the orders of the 
managers who were going to decide the strike. There- 
fore ho could not keep from the subject which so deeply 
interested him. 

"After all, what will you do ?" he asked, suddenly. 

M. Hennebeau trembled. He answered in a vague 
manner. 

"We will see." 

" Well, you have some capital back, and can afford 
to wait," said Deneulin, thinking aloud. " But I will 
be lost if the strike reaches Vandame. I have just 
been to the expense of newly fitting up Jean-Bart, and 
I must have a constant production to get along." 

That involuntary confession seemed to interest M. 
Deneulin. He listened, and a plan was formed. In case 
the strike was a bad one, he could let it run on until his 
neighbor was ruined, then purchase his mines at a Ioav 
price. It was the most sure means to get himself in 
the good graces of the Montson owners, who for some 
years had longed to possess Vandame. 

" If Jean-Bart is so much annoyance to you as that," 
said he, laughing, " why do you not let us have it ?" 

But Deneulin had already regretted his complaints. 
He cried: "Never, as long as I live." 

They laughed at his earnestness, and, for the moment. 



GEEMINAL. 169 

as the dessert appeared, the strike was forgotten. The 
ladies spoke about a receipt for the meringuée which 
they thought delicious, and the pine apple was declared 
equally good. The cheese and fruit, consisting of 
grapes and pears, brought to an end that exquisite 
lunch. They were all talking at the same time as the 
servant poured out the Rhine wine, used in place of 
champagne, which was considered common. 

At that dessert the marriage of Paul and Cécile took a 
step forward. His aunt had cast such pressing looks on 
the young man that he became very agreeable to the 
Gregoires, whom he had frightened almost to death by 
his tales of plunder. 

The servant had just brought the coffee as a maid 
entered filled with fright. 

"Monsieur; monsieur, they are here." 

It was the delegation. 

" Show them into the salon," said M. Hennebeau. 

For an instant the guests around the table looked 
uneasily at each other, then the jokes were resumed. 
One pretended to put the remainder of the sugar in his 
pocket, while they laughingly spoke of hiding the 
silver. But the director remained serious, and the 
smiles died away on their faces, while voices were 
lowered as the heavy steps of the delegates were heard 
in the next room. 

Mme. Hennebeau said to her husband in a low voice: 

" You will drink your coffee, will you not?" 

" Certainly," replied he. " Let them wait." 

He was nervous, listening at the least noise, though 
pretending to be occupied with his coffee. 

Paul and Cécile rose from the table. Choking with 
laughter she placed her eye to the key-hole while he 
softly whispered: 

''Do you see them?" 

*' Yes, I see a big one and two little ones behind him." 

*'Have they not abominable faces?" 

"Why no, they are very good looking." 

Suddenly M. Hennebeau left his chair, saying his 
coffee was too warm, he would drink it afterwards. As 
he was going out he put his finger to his mouth as if to 
say be silent. They had all seated themselves again. 



170 GERMI]S"AL. 

remaining at the table in silence, not daring to move, 
listening to that which was going on in the next room, 
uneasy at the loud voices of those men. 



CHAPTER XVIII. 



The night before, at a meeting held at Rasseneur's, 
Etienne and some others had chosen the delegates who, 
the following day, were to wait on the director. When 
la Maheu found that her husband was chosen as one of 
them she was in despair, asking why he should thus 
mix in the quarrel. Maheu himself had not accepted 
without repugnance, he was ill at ease and terribly 
frightened. In spite of their misery, when the time for 
action had come, both felt almost resigned to their lot, 
trembling for the next day, willing rather to bend to 
the will of their superiors. Usually Maheu submitted 
to the good judgment of his wife who was a very rea- 
sonable Avoman. But that time he became angry at 
her advice, even though he shared her fears. 

*' Shut up/' said he; "I'm doing my duty. I can^t 
go back on my comrades," 

After a long silence spent in thinking, she answered: 

" You're right. You must go; but Ave're lost." 

They lunched at noon, eating a few potatoes. A little 
butter still remained, but no one offered to touch it and 
it was carefully put away to use with the bread for the 
evening meal. At one o'clock the delegates were to 
meet at l'Avantage, and go from there to the director's 
house. 

" You know they count on you to speak," said Etienne 
to Maheu. 

The latter became speechless with fear. 

" Ah! no, that's too much," cried la Maheu. "I'm 
willing for him to go there, but I forbid his being the 
leader. . . . Why do they take him in preference 
to any other?" 

Then Etienne explained that Maheu was the best and 
most respected workman in the mine, whose good sense 
all believed in, and they wished him to tell the demands 
of all. At first they had chosen Etienne, but he had 



GERMIÎTAL. 171 

been in Montson such a short time that he thought the 
director would be more apt to listen to the complaints 
of an old miner So, finally the men had confided their 
interests to the one they thought the most worthy. He 
could not refuse, that would be foolish. 

Desperate, la Maheu cried out: 

*'Go, kill yourself for others, my man. I consent." 

"But I don't know enough," stammered he. **I 
should say foolish things.'' 

Etienne, relieved at having decided him, slapped him 
across the back. 

"You can say what you know, and that will be very 
good." 

With mouth full, Bonnemort, in whose legs the swell- 
ing was going down, listened, nodding his head. Then, 
after having drank a glass of water, the old man slowly 
murmured: 

" Say what you please, it will all be as though you 
had said nothing. I've seen these times before! Four 
years ago they sent us from the directors' door with 
blows of their swords. To-day, perhaps, they'll receive 
you, but they'll give you no more satisfaction than that 
wall. They have money; they don't care." 

A silence fell. Maheu and Etienne arose. Not a 
word was exchanged; they left the family sad at heart, 
seated before their empty plates. In the alley they 
stopped for Pierron and Levaque. Then the four men 
went to Rasseneur's, where the delegates from the 
neighboring alleys were arriving, one by one. When 
the twenty members were assembled, they all started 
out for Montson. The biting east wind swept past 
them. As the clocks were striking two, they arrived 
before the director's door. 

At first the servant closing the door on them left 
them in the yard, then, when he returned, he showed 
them into the salon and threw back the curtains. A 
soft light entered through the lace; and the miners 
remaining alone in embarrassment dared not sit down. 
They were very clean though, having shaved that 
morning and dressed in their best. They twisted their 
caps between their fingers, cast side-long glances around 
the room, which was furnished in the peculiar style 
which a taste for antiquity brought into fashion : Henri 



172 GERMINAL. 

deux arm-chairs, Louis quinze chairs, an Italian cabi- 
net of the sixteenth century, a Spanish contados of the 
fourteenth, a mantel lambrequin and curtains to match. 
All this gilt, silk and furs, this great luxury had filled 
them with a respectful uneasiness. The Turkish car- 
pets seemed to cling to their feet. But that which 
especially overcame them was the heat, the good even 
warmth from a furnace which burned their cheeks, 
frozen by the wind on the road. Five minutes passed. 
Their uneasiness increased more and more in that 
warm, rich room. 

At last M. Hennebeau entered, wearing in his button- 
hole the knot of his decoration. He was the first to 
speak. 

''Ah! here you are. ... So you have struck." 

He paused, adding with a stiff politeness. 

" Be seated. We will talk." 

The miners turned to find seats. A few risked them- 
selves in the arm-chairs, while others, afraid of the 
richly-embroidered silks, preferred to remain standing. 

Silence fell. M. Hennebeau, who had rolled his 
arm-chair before the fire-place, numbered them at a 
glance, trying to recall their faces and names. He had 
recognized Pierron standing in the last row, and his 
eyes were now fastened upon Etienne, who was seated 
before him. 

"Well," said he, "what have you to say to me?" 

He expected to hear the young man begin, and was 
so surprised to see Maheu rise that he could not conceal 
his astonishment. 

"What! you, a good workman, whose family gave 
the first blows of a pick in the Montson mine! Ah! 
this is too bad; it makes me angry to see you at the 
head of these men.^' 

Maheu waited with head bent. Then he com- 
menced, with voice at first hesitating and low. 

"Monsieur le directeur, it's just because I am a 
peaceable man that my comrades have chosen me to 
tell you that we're not hot-headed men anxious for a 
fight. All we want is justice. We are tired of being 
hungry, and we think it time to arrange so that we 
can at least have bread enough to eat." 



GEEMIKAL. 173 

His voice became firm. He raised his eyes and con- 
tinued, looking straight at the director. 

" You knew that we could'nt accept your new system. 
You accuse us of bad propping. It^s true we don't give 
that work the time needed. But if we did we'd earn 
less than we do now, and in the end would be sure to 
starve. Pay us more and we'll prop better, we'll spend 
every hour at the timbering that you want. Won't you 
make some other arrangement ? To get work done it must 
be paid for. Look at what you have done now, cut 
down the price of the cars and then pretend to make it 
equal by paying us in part for the timbering. Even if 
that was true you'd be stealing from us all the same, 
for the propping would always take us a longer time. 
But what makes us mad is that it's not even true, the 
company does'nt make up our loss, it simply puts two 
centimes per car in its own pocket." 

''Yes, yes, it's true," said the^other delegates on seeing 
M. Hennebeau make a violent gesture as if to interrupt 
him. 

However Maheu prevented the director from speak- 
ing. Now he was launched, words came freely. For 
some moments he had listened to himself in surprise as 
if it was a stranger speaking. They were the thoughts 
gathered together deep down in his heart, things which 
he had not even known to be there, and which came forth 
in a burst of passion. He spoke of their misery, the 
hard labor, the beast-like life, the wives and little ones 
at home crying of hunger. He mentioned the last dis- 
asterous pay day when almost their whole salary had 
been taken from them for propping and fines. Did they 
wish to kill them? 

" Then, Monsieur le directeur," said he in con- 
cluding, " we have come to tell you that we prefer 
starving at once, rather than to work without earning 
bread to eat. "We have left the mines and will only go 
back when the company accepts our conditions. It 
wanted to lower the price of the cars and pay in part 
for the timbering. We want things to remain as tbey 
were, and also five centimes more per car. Now it is 
for you to decide if you are for Justice and work." 

" That's it," cried some of the men. '* He's said our 
idea. We only ask for what's right." 



174 GERMINAL. 

Others, without speaking, approved "with energetic 
nods. 

The luxurious room, filled with its gildings, em- 
broideries and mysterious heaps of antiquities, had all 
disappeared; they no longer even felt the soft carpet, 
which was crushed beneath their heavy boots. 

" Allow me to reply," cried M. Hennebeau, who had 
now become angry. " In the first place, it is not true 
that the company gains two centimes per car on the 
new mode of salary. . . . 1^11 show the figures if 
you wish." 

A confused discussion followed. The director, to try 
and divide them, appealed to Pierron, who, stammering 
some unintelligible words, retreated furtlier in the 
background. Levaque, on the contrary, was among the 
most aggressive, confirming everything, even that of 
which he was ignorant. The heavy murmur of their 
voices was drowned among the numerous tapestries of 
that oven-like room. 

" If you all talk at once," resumed M. Hennebeau, 
**we will never understand each other." 

He had again become the calm ruler who gives an 
order and intends to have it respected. He constantly 
watched Etienne, endeavoring once or twice to draw 
him out of the forbidding silence in which he was 
buried. So, abandoning the discussion about the two 
centimes, he suddenly broke forth : 

"Now, tell the truth, you are obeying some one's 
instructions. It is a pest now which has blown upon the 
workmen and corrupted the best of them. ... I 
need no confession. I see very well that you are 
changed ; you who until now were so peaceable. Have 
they not promised you more butter than bread, telling 
you that your turn had come to be masters ? . . . 
I bet you have already joined the International, that 
army of robbers whose dream is the destruction of so- 
ciety." 

Then Etienne interrupted him. 

*'You are mistaken. Monsieur le directeur. Not a 
coal man of Montson has adhered. But, if you push 
them too far, perhaps all the mines will enroll them- 
selves. It depends on the company." 

From that moment the fis^ht was carried on between 



GEEMIN"AL. 175 

M. Hennebeau and Etienne, as though the other miners 
were not even there. 

"The company is good to its men; you are wrong to 
threaten it. Only this year it has spent tliree hundred 
thousand france in building houses, without speaking of 
the pensions, the coal and the medicine which it gives 
away. You seem intelligent, for in a few months you 
have become one of our most clever workmen. Would 
you not do better to think over these truths, than to 
associate yourself with people of bad reputation? Yes, 
I wish to speak of Rasseneur, whom we were compelled 
to discharge in order to save our miners from his socialist 
rot. . . . You are always at his house, and he must 
have advised you to organize that saving fund. That 
we would allow willingly if it was only a saving fund, 
but if it became a missile against us, a reserve fund with 
which to pay the expenses of war, I must add that the 
company insist upon having control of it.^' 

Etienne allowed him to continue, looking straight into 
his eyes, while he nervously bit his lips. He smiled at 
the last sentence, answering simply: 

" This is still a new imposition of which Monsieur 
le directeur has spoken to us. . . . But unhappily, 
our wish is that the company should occupy itself less 
with us, and instead of playing the role of benefactor, 
that it should show itself just in giving us that which 
belongs to us, the gain of which it robs us. Is it hon- 
orable for them to let the workmen die of hunger to 
save the dividends of the stockholder? Monsieur le 
directeur cannot honestly deny that the new system has 
only been started as a means of cutting down the salar- 
ies, and that which angers us is that when the company 
is forced to be economical, it always begins on the work- 
man. '* 

"Ah! here it is," cried M. Hennebeau. "I was 
waiting for the accusation that it lived by the sweat of 
a famished people. How can you talk such nonsense, 
you who ought to know what enormous risks the stock 
holders run in this business. A mine all equipped 
costs from fifteen hundred thousand francs to two mill- 
ions; why it is scarcely possible to draw even a slight 
interest from such an enormous cost. Nearly half of 
the mining companies in France are bankrupt. It is 



176 GERMINAL. 

stupid to accuse those who are still -working of cruelty. 
"When their workmen suffer, they suffer also. Do you 
not believe the company has as much to lose as you in 
an actual crisis. It is not the mistress of salaries; it 
obeys competition under fear of ruin. Look at the 
facts. . . . But you do not want to hear, you do 
not want to understand.'^ 

"Yes," said the young man. "We understand very 
well that there is no possible improvement for us as 
long as things go on as they do, and on that account, 
one day or another, the workmen will try and arrange 
things to suit themselves.^' 

These words were pronounced with such conviction 
that a thoughtful silence followed them. An uneasi- 
ness, filled with fear, seemed to pass through that salon. 
The other delegates, who did not comprehend all that 
had been said, felt, nevertheless, that their comrade 
was fighting for them, and they again threw sidelong 
glances on all that luxury, those baubles, which would 
have fed them for a month. 

Finally, Mr. Hennebeau, who had been lost in 
thought, arose to dismiss them, and as Etienne nudged 
Maheu's elbow, the latter again began speaking. 

" Then, monsieur, I must say to the others that you 
refuse?" 

" Me, my good man ! " cried the director. " I refuse 
nothing. I am paid a salary, and have no more will 
here than your smallest child. They give me orders, 
and my only duty is to see that they are carried out. I 
have said to you what I believed was right, but I am 
not the one to decide. You have made known your 
demands, which I shall send to the company, after 
which their answer will be given you." 

He spoke in a decided manner, explaining himself to 
be a simple instrument in the hands of the owners. 
And the miners now looked on him with suspicion, 
asking themselves what interest he could have in lying 
— what he would derive by thus putting himself between 
them and the true masters. He, a paid workman, and 
living so well. 

Etienne again spoke out : 

"Why can't we plead our cause in person ? We 
would explain a great many things which would neces- 



GERxMINAL. 177 

sarily escape your memory, if we only knew where to 
address the masters." 

M. Hennebeau only smiled. 

" Ah ! so you no longer trust me. Well, it would be 
necessary for you to go down there." 

The delegates had followed his uncertain gesture, his 
hand being stretched toward one of the salon windows. 
"Where was that ? Paris, no doubt. Still, they did not 
know where they would find that unknown God 
throned. They would never see him, and only felt in 
him a power which bore down upon the ten thousand 
coal men of Montson. And when the director was 
speaking, it was that power which he had behind him. 

They were all discouraged. Even Etienne said it was 
time they left, and, as Maheu started for the door, M. 
Hennebeau touched him on the shoulder, asking after 
Jeanlin. 

" That should have been a lesson to you, but it was 
not ; and now you are striking when you know that 
before a week has passed you will all die of hunger. I 
calculated on your having some wisdom left, and shall 
expect you all to descend by Monday at the latest." 

All the men started forth, leaving the parlor without 
answering a word to that hope of submission. The 
director accompanied them to the door, still thinking 
over the affair. The company on one side with its new 
tariff, the workmen on the other with their demand for 
an increase of five centimes per car. Well, he could 
only promise a prompt answer from the company; but, 
in advance, not to leave them any hope, he informed 
them that their conditions were sure to be refused. 

"Reflect before doing anything foolish," said he, 
uneasy at their silence. 

In the hall Pierron bowed very low, while Levaque 
started to put on his cap. Maheu was searching for a 
last word when Etienne again knocked his elbow, and 
they all went off in tliat threatening silence, the door 
alone closing behind them with a great noise. 

When M. Hennebeau returned to the dining-room, he 
found his guests still seated motionless at the table. In 
a few words he told his uneasiness, which made a deep 
gloom settle down upon the face of Deneulin. While 
he was drinking his now cold coffee, they tried to speak 
13 



178 GERMINAL. 

of other things. But even the Gregoires returned to 
the strike, astonished that there was no hiw to compel 
the workmen to return to their work. Paul reassured 
Cécile by saying that they could send for the gendarmes. 

M. Hennebeau called the servant. 

"Hippolyte, before we go into the salon, open all the 
windows and let in some fresh air. 



CHAPTER XIX. 



Fifteen days had passed, and on Monday of the 
third week, the account sent in to the diïector showed 
a new decrease in the number of workmen who had 
descended. They had counted on the miners beginning 
work again that day. But the obstinacy of the owners 
not to yield had exasperated them. It was not only the 
Yoreux, Crèvecoeur, Minon, la Madeleine that were 
standing still; but la Victoire and Feutry-Cantel now 
counted scarcely a quarter of its menj and even the 
Avorkmen at Saint Thomas had gone over to the fight. 
Little by little the strike had become general. 

A heavy silence fell over the Yoreux, from which no 
longer black forms could be seen returning from their 
day's labor. Under the gray December sky stood three 
or four forgotten cars, adding to the desolation. 

Under the thin trussels of the bridges the stock of 
coal was growing low, leaving the ground bare and 
black ; while the provision of wood lessened under the 
heavy rains. At the canal wharf a half-loaded boat 
quietly lay in the muddy water, and on the desert plain 
stood a cart with its shafts sticking up toward the dull 
sky. But the buildings especially seemed deserted, the 
screening-shed was closed up. In the tower was no 
longer heard the constant rolling of cars, while in the 
boiler room where the fires were low the air was almost 
as cold as the day outside. The giant chimney was too 
large now for the slight smoke which curled from it. 
The engine Avas only run in the morning when the sta- 
blemen descended to care for the horses ; the overseers 
worked alone at the bottom, watching for disasters 
which injured the paths as soon as they were no longer 



Germikal. 1-79 

kept up, so after nine o'clock the ladders were used. 
And above those dead buildings shrouded in their sheet 
of black dust, there was not even heard, but for a short 
time in the morning, the escaping steam, blowing its 
long and loud whistle. 

Nearest the Voreux was the alley. Deux- Cent- 
Quarante, which also seemed dead. The prefect of 
Lille had arrived, gendarmes paced the roads. But 
before the calmness of the strikers, prefect and gendarmes 
had returned home. The alleys had never been so quiet. 
The men, to avoid going to the saloons, slept the entire 
day; the women, by putting themselves on short allow- 
ance of coffee had become reasonable, less anxious to talk 
and quarrel; and even the bands of children seemed to 
be infected with that calm, for they ran with their bare 
feet and would slap each other without making a noise. 
It was an order which had run from mouth to mouth: be 
quiet and be wise. 

Nevertheless there was a continual going and coming 
from Maheu's house. Etienne, the secretary, had 
divided off the three thousand francs of the saving 
fund to the needy families. This sum had been en- 
larged by some hundred francs given by subscription. 
But, to-day, the supply v&gt;^as used up, the miners had no 
more money to support the strike and the end was 
threatening them. Maigrat, after having promised to 
trust them for two weeks, at the end of eight days 
suddenly changed his mind; cutting off their provisions, 
even refusing them bread. He received all the orders 
of the company; and perhaps it wished to end the fight 
by starving the people. And it was especially to the 
]\Iaheus whom he shut his door with a spiteful rage. 
For a week they had been living from the saving fund, 
but now that it had given out, where would they find 
bread? To add to the misery it began snowing, the 
women soon lessened their pile of coal thinking uneasily 
that there was no more to come until the men went back to 
work. It was not enough to be slovv'ly starving, but 
they must suffer from cold also. 

At Maheu's everything was gone. The Levaque's 
had almost used up the twenty franc piece loaned them 
by Bouteloupe. The Pierrons always had money, but 
appeared as starved as the others, fearing they would 



180 GERMIKAL. 

wish to borrow from them. Since Saturday many 
families had gone supperless to bed, and though the 
future looked terrible, not a complaint was heard, all 
obeyed the word of command with a quiet courage. In 
Etienne they placed absolute confidence, a religious 
faith, the blind gift of a population of believers, for he 
had promised them the era of justice and they were 
ready to suifer for the conquest of universal hap})iness. 
Hunger turned their heads; never had dark horizon ex- 
panded into anything so bright as that which they 
imagined. With eyes dim from suffering, they saw the 
ideal city of their dreams, with its brotherhood of 
people, its golden age of work and its common repast. 
Nothing disturbed the conviction which had gradually 
come upon them. The fund was exhausted, the com- 
pany would not yield, each day their situation became 
more grave, but they still hoped on. They showed 
their contempt by smiling at facts. That faith took 
the place of bread and made them forget their hunger. 
From this time forward Etienne was the unques- 
tioned chief. In the talks held each evening he became 
an oracle. He read constantly, receiving a great num- 
ber of letters; and he even subscribed to the Prolétaire, 
a socialist paper published in Belgium, and that 
journal, the first which had ever entered the alley, had 
raised him still higher in the estimation of his com- 
rades. His growing popularity filled him with a deli- 
cious intoxication. He now kept up an extended cor- 
respondence discussing the workingman's lot at the four 
corners of the world, consulted by all the miners of the 
Voreux and listened to attentively by every one, from 
the old mechanics down to the diggers with hands greasy 
and black. As if mounting a ladder he went up step 
by step into that refined state which he could hardly 
believe possible. A single thing caused him to worry, 
his want of instruction, the lack of knowledge which 
made him uneasy and timid when he found himself 
face to face with a gentleman. He continued to in- 
struct himself, devouring everything, but the want of 
method made his progress very slow. At certain times 
he experienced great uneasiness as to the wisdom of his 
actions, perhaps they should consult a lawyer, a learned 
man capable of speaking and acting without exposing 



GERMIXAL. 181 

him or compromising his comrades. But he immedi- 
ately revolted at that idea. No, no; not lawyers, they 
use their skill to enrich themselves from the people. 
It would come right of its own accord, the workmen 
should attend to their own affairs. And his wish for 
popularity decided him. Monston at his feet, Paris not 
far off, and he pictured to himself the amazement of 
the aristocracy on seeing a workingman in Parliament. 

For some days Etienne had been perplexed. Pluchart 
had written letter after letter offering to come to 
Montson to warm up the zeal of the miners. He wished 
to organize a society which the mechanic should preside 
over, and he thought to win for the International the 
most of the miners who had Deen so mistrustful, 
Etienne feared creating a disturbance, but nevertheless 
he would have allowed Pluchart to come if Rasseneur 
had not been so violently set against it, for in spite 
of his power, the young man still w-ent to the saloon- 
keeper for advice. 

This Monday about four o'clock, another letter ar- 
rived from Lille. Etienne was alone in the house witli 
la Maheu, for Maheu, incapable of being idle, had 
gone fishing under the lockage of the canal, hoping 1o 
have the luck to catch a big fish which they could sell 
to buy bread. Old Bonnemort and little Jeanlin had 
gone for the first walk since they had lost the use of 
their limbs, while the children were out with Alzire 
who passed hours trying to pick up a few cinders. 

When the young man held up the letter, she asked : 

"Is it good news ? Are they going to send us some 
money ? " 

As he shook his head, she answered : 

" I don't know what we're going to do this week. 
But we've got the right on our side, so we can hold 
out." 

She upheld the strike now. It would have been better 
to force the company to be just without leaving work. 
But as they had left it they ought not to return until 
their demands were agreed to. It would be better to 
die than give in and say they were wrong, when they 
were right. 

"Ah!" cried Etienne. "If the cholera would come 
we would get rid of those who take advantage of us." 



182 GERMINAL. 

"No, no," she answered. *'We must never wish 
death to anybody, it would do us no good if they died, 
for others would come up in their places. I only ask 
that they be brought around to more reasonable ideas. 
There are some good people everywhere." 

She did not like his violent words, his constant wish 
to fight against everything. What was the use of his 
occupying himself with so many things, with the mas- 
ters and the government? Why meddle in other people's 
business when it would do him no good. She only re- 
spected him because he did not drink and gave her his 
forty-five francs for board. AVhen a man was steady one 
could forgive everything else. 

Etienne then talked about the republic which would 
give bread to every one. But la Maheu shook her 
head, for she remembered the year of forty- eight which 
had left them still worse off. And forgetting all else 
she told him of that year of sufi'ering. 

" Not a liard," murmured she. " The mines stopped 
running and the people died of hunger." 

At that moment the door opened, and both were 
s])eechless with astonishment as Catherine entered. 
She had never before reappeared in the alley since she 
ran away with Cheval. In confusion, she still held the 
door open, standing on the threshold as though afraid 
to enter. No doubt she expected to find her mother 
alone, and the sight of the young man made her forget 
the speech which she had prepared on the road. 

"What do you come here for?" said la Maheu. "I 
don't want you, go away." 

Then Catherine spoke out. 

" I did a little work, and I thought of the children. 
I've brought some coffee and sugar." 

She drew from her pocket a pound of sugar and an- 
other of coffee, which she placed on the table. While 
she worked at Jean-Bart the strike in the Voreux worried 
her, and under pretense of thinking of the little ones, 
she had come to help her family. But her kindness 
had no effect upon her mother, who replied: 

" Instead of bringing us some sweets, you would have 
done better to have stayed to work for us." 

She threw up to her all that she had said to Etienne. 
To run away with a man when only sixteen years old 



GERMINAL. 183 

and when her family was in need too, she ought to have 
been the last to have done such a thing. Had they 
ever kept her tied up? Not at all, she was free as the 
air; they only asked her to come home to sleep. 

Catherine stood listening before the table. Her 
slight form shook, she tried to answer, interrupting her 
mother. 

" It wasn^t me. It was him. What he want^s I have 
got to want, don't you seo, he's the strongest. Do 
people know how things come about? they're done and 
can't be undone. And, besides, he's going to marry 
me." 

She defended herself as best she could, without shame, 
only trembling to think her mother treated her so 
badly before that young man whose presence oppressed 
her. 

Etienne arose, pretending to rake up the fire, which 
was out, and their eyes met. He thought her pale and 
tired looking, but still pretty with her clear eyes. He 
felt a singular feeling toward her; his illness was gone, 
he simply wished to see her happy with the man she 
preferred to him. He would liked to have gone to 
Montsou and forced the other to treat her better. She 
saw his pitying glances, but thought he must despise 
her to look at her thus. Then with heart almost burst- 
ing, she stood silent unable to find other words of 
excuse. 

"If that's it, you'd better shut up," replied the 
mother, implacable. "If you've come back to stay, all 
right; if not, get out right away, and consider yourself 
happy that I have got Estelle here in my lap, or I'd have 
kicked you from the door." 

Suddenly, as if that threat had been realized, Cath- 
erine received a violent blow on the back. It was 
Cheval who had been watching her for some time from 
the still open door. 

"I've followed you," he howled. " I knew you were 
coming here to be insulted and kicked out. So you've 
been buying them coffee with my money." 

La Maheu and Etienne, stupefied, did not move, 
as Cheval moved toward the door. 

"Get out of here now." and when the girl took 
refucre in the corner he began cursing the mother. 



184 GERMINAL. 

Then taking Catherine by the arm he shook her, 
dragging her outside. 

Etienne, mad with rage, flew after him, and the two 
men were face to face, with murder in their eyes. It 
was an old hatred, an unacknowledged jealousy, which 
now burst forth. One or the other must win now. 

"Take care," yelled Etienne, 'Til kill you." 

" Try it," answered Cheval. 

They glared at each other for a few seconds, panting 
for breath. Then Catherine dragged her lover away, 
and pulling him out of the alley, she flew on without 
looking behind her. 

"What a brute! " said Eteinne, slamming the door to. 

La Maheu had not moved. She shrugged her shoul- 
ders, and a painful silence fell. 

" He is a pig," said she at last. 

Then Etienne arose and went out, while she, laying 
Estelle on two chairs, began raking the fire. If the 
father caught and sold a fish they would have some soup. 

Outside, a bitter cold night was coming on. With 
head bent, Etienne walked on filled with gloomy sad- 
ness. He no longer felt angered toward the man, or 
pity for the poor, illtreated girl. The brutal scene was 
effaced by the sufferings of all those miserable people. 
He saw these women and little children who had not 
bread to eat, trying to forget their hunger, and the 
doubt which before now had passed through his mind, 
came upon him again in that melancholy twilight. 
What a terrible responsibility he had charged himself 
with. Should he push their resistance still farther, now 
that he had neither money nor credit? How would it 
end if assistance did not arrive, and hunger abated their 
courage? Suddenly a vision appeared to him of the 
future. Children dying and dead, mothers crying and 
fathers, emaciated and weak, going back to the mines. 
He still walked on, stumbling over stones, while this 
idea occurred to him that the company would be the 
stronger, and he would have made all this unhappiness 
for his comrades, filling him with terrible anguish. 

When he raised his head, he saw that he was be- 
fore the Voreux. The gloomy mass of buildings were 
even darker under the growing night. In the midst 
of the desert plain these great motionless shadows 



GERMIXAL. 185 

looked like the corner of an abandoned fortress. At 
that hour in the evening everything was still, no light 
was seen, not a voice heard. And even the sound of 
escaping steam seemed to come from a greater distance 
than that dreary mine. 

Etienne looked on, and the blood flew back to his 
heart. If the workmen suffered from hunger, th.e 
company was losing millions. Why should it be the 
stronger in that fight of labor against capital ? In 
either case victory would be dearly bought. He was 
filled with a wish to fight on, even though it ended in 
death. Was it not as well for the people to die at once, 
as to starve to death by inches ? Some. badly digested 
readings returned to him ; accounts of people who had 
burned their town to stop the enemy ; tales where 
mothers saved their infants from slavery by beating out 
their brains upon the pavement, while men died rather 
than eat the bread of tyrants. That exalted him ; his 
gloomy sadness and doubt disappeared, while he felt 
ashamed of his cowardice of an hour before. And in 
that return of confidence, bursts of pride reappeared 
and carried him still higher ; then followed joy at be- 
ing their chief, obeyed by all. He imagined the time 
when authority should be in the hands of the people, 
and he would be master. 

But he started as the voice of Maheu rang out in the 
darkness, telling him of a superb trout caught and sold 
for three francs. They would have some soup. Then 
he left the comrade who said he would return home in 
a short time, and entering l'Avantage Etienne sat down 
at a table near Jouvarine waiting for the departure of a 
customer to frankly tell Easseneur that he intended 
writing to Pluchart to come immediately. His resolu- 
tion was taken, he wished to organize a private mutiny, 
for victory seemed sure, if the coal men of Montson 
would all adhere to the International. 



186 GEKMINAL. 



CHAPTER XX. 

The meeting was to be held on Thursday at two 
o'clock at the Bon-Joyeux. The old woman was ex- 
asperated at the misery which had been made for her 
children, the coal men, especially as her saloon was 
always empty. Never had strikers been less thirsty, 
even the drunkards fastened themselves in their homes 
rather than disobey wise orders given them. The 
streets of Montson which were so crowded on fete days 
now bore a mournful air of desolation. No more beer 
was handed over the bars. Before le Casemuir and 
le Progress nothing was to be seen but the pale faces of 
the saloonkeepers, watching the road, l'Enfant, Tison, 
Piquette, Tote-coupee all were deserted, only Saint-Eloi 
which was frequented by the overseers, drinks were still 
poured out. Even at the Volcan, which was kept by a 
woman, no sound was heard. 

" Great heavens!" cried old Desir. " The gendarmes 
would be after me if they found it out, but I must fool 
them." 

She had acceeded with pleasure to the demands of 
Etienne. Her entire house should be given up to the 
miners, she would lend them her ball-room gratuitously, 
and even send out the invitations if they wished. On 
the following day the young man carried her fifty letters 
to sign, which had been copied by the neighbors who 
knew how to write. These invitations were sent off to 
the delegates and some other men whom they could 
trust. The business of the day named was to discuss 
the continuation of the strike, and as Pluchart was ex- 
pected they counted on a talk from him to win the men 
over to join the International. 

Thursday morning Etienne became uneasy. Pluchart 
who had sent a dispatch saying he would be there on 
Wednesday evening, had not yet arrived. What was 
the matter? Etienne was in despair at not being able 
to have a talk with him before the meeting. At nine 
o'clock he went to Montson, thinking that the mechanic 
had perhaps gone straight there without stopping at the 
Voreux. 



GERMINAL. 187 

" No, I've not seen your friend/^ suid old Desir. 
"But every thing's ready. Come in and see." 

She led liini to the ball-room. The decoration re- 
mained the same, garlands of paper flowers reaching 
across the ceiling, but the musician's stand was replaced 
by a table and three chairs, and a number of benches 
ranged along the walls. 

"It's all right," said Etienne. 

"You must make yourself at home now. Bawl all 
you please. The gendarmes will have to pass over my 
body if they come." 

In spite of his uneasiness lie could not help smiling 
at her words. 

At that moment Easseneur and Jouvarine entered, 
and when the old woman left them together in the great 
empty hall, Etienne cried: 

"What! you here already?" 

Jouvarine had come in out of simple curosity. The 
machinists of the Voreux were not on a strike and he 
was now working at night. Kasseneur had seemed un- 
easy for two days; his round fat face had lost its jolly 
smile. 

"Did you know that Pluchart hasn't come yet?" 
said the young man to him. 

He turned his face aside and at last replied between 
his teeth: 

"That don't astonish me. I don't expect him." 

"Why?" 

Then looking the other in the face he replied with a 
brave air: 

" Because I wrote to him, if you wish to know, and 
in that letter I begged him not to come. Yes, I thought 
you ought to attend to your own affairs without asking 
strangers to help you." 

Etienne, trembling with rage, stammered out: 

"You did that; you did that?" 

" Certainly, I did that ; and you know moreover I 
have some confidence in Pluchart. He's sly, but a per- 
son can get along with him. But your ideas would 
make one crazy. Politics, government — all that sets 
me crazy. What I want is to see the miners better 
treated. I worked at the bottom for twenty years, and 
suffered so much misery that I swore to obtain some 



188 GERMIKAL. 

ease for the poor devils who are there still. I know 
very well that you'll get nothing at all with your fool- 
ishness ; you'd make the life of the workmen still more 
miserable. When hunger forces them to go back to 
work they'll be ground down still more, the company'll 
pay them back with blows like an escaped dog which 
has been made to return to his kennel. I want to pre- 
vent that if I can. Do you understand?" 

His voice grew louder, and his calm, reasonable nat- 
ure clearly shown out in his words, which came freel}^ 
without effort. Was it not stupid to think that tliey 
could change the world in a moment — to put the work- 
men in the place of aristocrats and divide the money 
like a lot of apples? It would take thousands and 
thousands of years to do that. Why did they ruin 
their peace of mind by talking of miracles? The most 
stuj^id person should know better than that. Instead 
of making fools of themselves, why did they not en- 
deavor to lead the comjDany by their good conduct to 
make a better condition of things? 

Etienne, filled with indignation, allowed him to 
speak on, then he cried : 

" Great heavens, have you no blood in your veins?" 

To resist a temptation to strike him, he walked up 
and down the room with great strides, occasionally sit- 
ting down on one of the benches; at last he opened the 
door leading to the bar room. 

" Shut the door," said Jouvarine. " We don't want 
people to hear us." 

On coming in the engineer had seated himself on one 
of the chairs before the desk. After rolling a cigarette, 
he watched the two others with his keen, yet sharp 
eyes, his lips curled with a slight smile. 

"It does no good to get angry," resumed Easseneur. 
" I saw from the first that you had some good sense. It 
was very wise of you to take command of the strikers, 
to force them to remain at home, using your wisdom to 
obtain order, but now you are trying to get them into 
trouble." 

At each of his turns Etienne flew up to the saloon- 
keeper and taking him by the shoulder shook him, cry- 
ing his replies in the man's face. 

'* Yes, I have imposed discipline on them. I still 



GERMINAL. 189 

advise them not to give in. But it was not necessary 
for you to make a fool of me in this way. . . . 
You pride yourself on keeping cool; as for me there are 
times when I fear I am going mad.'' 

He mocked at his first impressions as those of a 
neophyte, at his religious dream of a place where justice 
would soon reign between men who had become brothers. 
Let them cross their arms and wait if they wished to 
see until the end of the world men devour one another 
like so many wolves. No, they must take things in 
their own hands or injustice would be eternal, the rich 
always sucking the blood of the poor. He could not 
pardon himself for being foolish enough to have form- 
erly said that they must banish the political from the 
social question. He was ignorant then, but since he 
had read and studied his ideas had become matured: he 
now boasted of having a system. However, he explained 
it badly, in confused sentences which still kept a little 
of all the theories gone over and successively al)andoned. 
At the head remained the ideas of Karl Marx, that 
capital was the result of spoliation and that work had 
the right and sliould enter into that stolen riches. 
Only things became confused as soon as he passed on to 
a practical programme. At first Proudhon had tempted 
him with the chimera of mutual credit, a vast bank of 
exciiange which would abolish all others; then he fan- 
cied the co-operative society of Lasalle, endowed bv the 
commonwealth which little by little would transform 
the earth into a single industrial town, then the ques- 
tion of honest managers and the difficulty of control 
had disgusted him with it, and he had paused for a 
time at collectiveness, which demanded that all the in- 
struments of labor should be rendered up into a collec- 
tion. His rallying cry in the strike was: "La mine 
au mineur!" He did not yet know how to realize his 
new dream, which again brought up scruples as to its 
being sensible and right. He simply said that it was 
the question to take possession of the government be- 
fore all. Then they would see. 

'' But why have you changed; why have you gone over 
to the owners' side?" continued he, returning and 
standing before the saloon-keeper. " You have owned 
up to it yourself.-" 



190 GEEilîNAL. 

Easseiieur slowly reddened. 

*'Yes, I said so, and I'm no more of a coward than 
any other. . . . Only I refuse to be with those who 
get everything into a mess just to make a position for 
themselves.'' 

Etienne appeared uneasy. The two men became 
disagreeable, their sullen rivalry gaining on them. It 
was in the end the question of persons which angered 
them, throwing one into a revolutionary exaggeration 
and the other into affected prudence, carrying them 
awuy in spite of themselves above their true ideas into 
these fatal roles which they otherwise would not think 
of choosing. And Jouvarine, who listened with dis- 
crete curiosity, showed upon his blonde, girlish face a 
contemptuous silence, the overwhelming scorn of a man 
ready to give his life obscurely without even posing as a 
martyr. 

" You mean that for me, do you ? " demanded Etienne. 
''You're jealous." 

"Jealous of what ?" replied Rasseneur. "I don't 
pose as a great man, nor do I try to form a society in 
Montson to become its secretary." 

The other endeavoied to interrupt him, but he added : 

"Be frank now; you're only using the International 
as a pretense to play the gentleman and commence a 
correspondence with the famous council of the north." 

A silence fell: then Etienne, very pale, replied: 

"I never thought to be reproached by you. I have 
always consulted you, for I knew that you fought here 
long before me. But when you would allow no one to 
say a word but yourself, I acted alone from that time 
on. And from the first 1 warned you that the meeting 
would be held even if Pluchart didn't come, and that 
the men would adhere in spite of you." 

"They haven't done so yet," murmured the saloon- 
keeper; "wait until they are asked for an assessment." 

"The International doesn't compel workmen on a 
strike to pay their dues at once. They can pay later 
on, and the society will come to our aid at once." 

Rasseneur suddenly became furious. 

"Well, we'll see! I'm here and I shall speak. I 
won't let you turn the heads of your friends. I will 
enlighten them upon their true interests. We'll see 



ÔERMIKAL. 191 

whom they'll follow — me, whom they've known for 
thirty years, or you, who have turned everything upside 
down in the one year that you've lived here. 'No; give 
me peace, and we'll soon see who's for war." 

And he went out, slamming the door. The garlands 
trembled ; the shields swung to and fro on the wall. 
Then the great room again fell into its peaceful quiet. 

Jouvarine was still smoking at the table. After 
having walked the floor for an instant in silence, 
Etienne burst forth. Was it his fault if the people had 
left that great fool to come to liim ? And he defended 
himself for having become popular, lie did not even 
know how it liad come about, this good feeling of the 
whole alley, the confidence of his companions, tlie in- 
fluence which he now had over them. He could not 
endure being accused of working for ambition, for his 
heart was as pure as an infant's. He grew indignant, 
protecting his fraternity. 

Suddenly, he paused before Jouvarine, crying : 

"If I was to cause a friend to shed one drop of 
blood, I would go to America at once." 

The machinist shrugged his shoulders, and a smile 
again crossed his face. 

''Blood," murmured he. ''What difference does 
that make ? The earth needs it." 

Etienne, watching him, became calm, and seated 
himself on the opposite side of the table. That blonde 
face, with those thoughtful eyes, sometimes made iiim 
flush up with uneasiness, while it acted singularly upon 
his will. Without one word from his comrade, con- 
quered by that silence alone, he felt himself calmed 
little by little. 

"What would you do if you v/cre in my place?" h.e 
asked. "Am I not right to wisli to act? It's best, is 
it not, for us to join that society? " 

Jouvarine after having slowly blown out a jet of 
smoke replied by using his favorite word. 

"Yes, it's foolishness, but the International will soon 
spread out. He's becoming interested." 

"Who?" 

"Him." 

He pronounced that word in a low voice, with an air 



192 GERMINAL. 

of religious fervor, loolving toward the east. It was of 
the master he spoke Bakounine the Exterminator. 

"He alone can do good, the others are all cowards," 
continued he. Before three years have passed the In- 
ternational under his government should overthrow the 
whole world. 

Etienne had become attentive. He burned for in- 
struction, to comprehend that passion for distruction of 
v/hich the Russian spoke of in but few words as though 
wishing to keep the mystery to himself. 

'•But explain it to me, what do you wish to do?" 

"To destroy all. No more nations, no more govern- 
ment, no more proprietors no more God nor religion." 

"I understand. Only what will that bring you to?" 

" To the common place without form, to a new world, 
to a recommencement of all." 

" And the means of execution, how do you expect to 
get to them? " 

"By tire, by poison, by the knife. Brigands are the 
true heroes, the popular avengers, the veritable revolu- 
tionists in action without phrases learnt from books. 
It will be necessary for a series of terrible occurences to 
happen in order to terrify the rich and awaken the peo- 
ple." 

In speaking, Jouvarine became terrible. He rose from 
his chair while a mystical flame shot from his clear eyes 
and his delicate hands were pressed against the table as 
though to crush it. Seized with fear, Etienne watched 
him, thinking of the tales which he had been told in 
confidence of boombs thrown into the palace of the 
czar, police chiefs beaten down by blows of a hammer 
like wild boars. A mistress of this man's, the only 
woman he had ever loved, hung at Moscow one May 
morning, while in the crowd he kissed her eyes for the 
last time. 

" No, no," murmured Etienne, with a gesture as if to 
ward off these abominable visions, "we haven't come to 
that yet. The assassin, the incendiary, never! It is 
terrible, it is unjust. All the miners would aid in 
strangling an assassin." 

He did not understand. His race refused the som- 
ber dream of the extermination of the world, mowed 
down close to the ground like a field of rye. But what 



GERMINAL. 193 

should they do, how beat back the people? He de- 
manded a reply. 

" Tell me your plan? We want to know what to do. 

Then Jouvurine, who had resumed his cigarette, said 
quietly, with a lifeless and lost look: 

" All reasonings upon the future are criminal, because 
they prevent destruction and impede the march of 
revolution," 

Etienne laughed in spite of the chill which crept 
over him at that reply, and he willingly confessed that 
there was some good in all that; he already compre- 
hended more and more, and perhaps later on he would 
believe. Only that would give too good a chance to 
Rasseneur if he related these words to his companions. 
He tried to be practical. 

Old Desir entered to invite them to lunch. They 
accepted and passed into the saloon which a movable 
partition separated from the ball-room during the week. 
When they had finished their omelette and cheese, still 
an hour remained. Etienne was uneasy for he had 
counted on Pluchart. At half-past one the delegates 
commenced to arrive and he was obliged to receive them, 
for he wished to watch the entrances, fearing that the 
company might send their usual spies. He examined 
each letter of invitation, looking each person in the face. 
Those whom he knew, even though without invitations, 
were admitted. At two o'clock Rasseneur, who had 
been quietly smoking a pipe before his own counter, 
returned. That sigbt unnerved Etienne all the more, 
especially as some fellows had come there simply for 
fun, Zacharie, Moquet and some others ; these boys 
laughed at the strike, thinking it nice to do nothing, 
and sitting down at a table spent their last two sous for 
drinks. They laughed at their comrades, telling them 
they were going to do some foolish things. 

A quarter of an hour had passed when Jouvarine 
came out to say that the men were growing impatient. 
Then Etienne in his despair became resolute, and he was 
about to follow the machinist back to the ball-room, 
when old Desir, who had been watching the road, cried : 

" Here's your gentleman." 

They flew to the door. It was really Pluchart. He 
had arrived in a carriage drawn by a winded horse. He 
13 



194 GERMINAL. 

immediately jumped out upon the pavement. He was 
slight, insipid-looking, with a large square head, look- 
ing like a well-to-do workmen dressed in his Sunday 
best. For five years he had not done a stroke of work, 
and he took great care of himself, being particular 
about the manner in which his slightly gray hair was 
combed. His limbs were still stiff, and the nails of his 
large hands had never grown again after leaving off 
work. Very active, he rendered an honest service to 
his ambition beating about the provinces without rest 
to advance his socialistic ideas. 

"Ah! don't bear any ill will against me," said he, 
anticipating the questions. " Yesterday there was a 
meeting at Preuilly in the morning and in the evening 
a conference at Valencay. To-day I was obliged to 
meet Lauvagnat at Marchiennes. . . . Then I was 
able to procure a carriage to bring me here. But I am 
weary, you can tell by my voice. Still that makes no 
difference. I'll speak, all the same." 

He was entering the Bon-Joyeux when a thought 
struck him. 

" Gracious! I've forgotten the cards. We must do 
things right." 

He returned to the carriage which the coachman was 
already turning around, and he took from the seat a 
little black wooden case, which he carried in under his 
arm. 

Etienne, happy, walked behind him, while Rasseneur 
ill at ease, held out his hand, which the other took, 
speaking a hasty word about the letter; what a strange 
idea! Why should they not have that meeting, they 
should always have one when they were able. Desir 
asked him to take a drink, but he refused, he could 
talk without drinking, and he was in a hurry as he 
must be at Joiselle that night. He wished to have a 
talk with a man there named Legoujeux. They all 
entered the ball room together. Maheu and Levaque, 
who had just arrived, followed them in and the door 
was locked, in order to be more private. 

A hundred miners were waiting there. Heads were 
turned and wliispers heard as the newcomers sat down 
in the empty seats. They looked at the gentleman 



GERMIXAL. 195 

from Lille, whose black frock coat caused a surprise 
and uneasiness. 

But, ou the proposition of Etienne, they constituted 
the bureau. He called the names and the others ap- 
proved by raising their hands. Piuchart was made 
president, then Maheu and Etienne were chosen asses- 
sors. There was a moving of chairs and the bureau 
installed itself. For an instant the president disap- 
peared under the table where he placed the little box 
which he had not yet let go of. When he again 
appeared he struck a light blow with his fist to call the 
m.eeting to order, then he began in a hoarse voice: 

"Citizens. . . ." 

A small door opened. It was Desir who had come 
around by the kitchen bearing six drinks on a waiter. 

"Don't disturb yourself," said she. "Wlien a per- 
son speaks they're bound to be thirsty though." 

Jouvarine, sitting near the gentleman, took the waiter 
from her and set it on a corner of the table. Piuchart 
could now continue, he thanked them for his good recep- 
tion, excusing himself for being late, spoke of his 
fatigue and sore throat. Then he sat down to allow 
Easseneur to speak. 

The saloon-keeper had already stationed himself near 
the table beside the drinks. A turned over chair served 
him as a platform; he was much confused and coughed 
before letting out his full voice: 

"Comrades. . . ." 

That which gave him power over the miners was the 
facility with which he spoke, the good nature shown to 
them, without ever growing tired, risking no gestures, 
he remained grave yet smiling, astonishing them so 
much that they cried, "Yes, yes it's true, you're right." 
But this day from his first words he felt a sullen opposi- 
tion as he prudently advanced. He only discussed the 
continuation of the strike, waiting to be applauded 
before attacking the International. 

Without doubt, honor forbade them to yield to the 
unreasonableness of the company; only what misery, 
what a terrible future was before them if they held out 
longer. And without speaking of becoming submissive 
he weakened their courage by pointing out the people 
in the alleys dying of hunger;' he wished to know upon 



196 GERMINAL. 

what resources they counted. The applause of a few 
friends only served to emphasize the cold silence of the 
greater number whose disapprobation became greater 
and greater. Then in despair of winning them back 
his rage carried him away. He predicted unhappiness 
and grief for them if their heads were turned by the 
words of a stranger. All arose in anger, wishing to 
prevent him from saying more, after he had insulted 
and treated them like children incapable of taking care 
of themselves. And he, drinking gulp by gulp some 
drafts of beer, spoke in the midst of the tumult, crying 
violently that the man was not yet born who could pre- 
vent him from doing his duty. 

Pluchart stood up, and having no bell,' he beat on the 
table with his fist, saying in his hoarse voice: 

"Citizens; citizens. . . ." 

Finally he obtained a slight calm and the meeting 
called to order. They took the word from Easseneur. 
The delegates who had represented the miners in the 
interview with the director led on the others with their 
ideas. It ended in a determined vote to advance. 

''What difference does it make to you? You've got 
enough to eat," yelled Levaque, shaking his fist at 
Easseneur. 

Etienne, behind the president, Avas trying to quiet 
Maheu who had flashed up with a terrible rage at that 
canting talk, while Jouvarine looked on little by little 
becoming warmed up, a flame at the bottom of his 
clear eyes. 

" Citizens,*' said Pluchart, "permit me to speak." 

A profound silence fell. He began speaking in a 
hoarse voice but he was accustomed to talking and little 
by little he inflated his throat, drawing out some pathetic 
efforts. With outstretched arms he accompanied his 
sentences with a singular movement of the shoulders. 
He had the eloquence of a clergyman or lecturer with a 
habit of letting fall the close of his sentences of which 
the humming monotone ended by convincing. 

And he began his discourse on the greatness and 
goodness of the International. He explained its aim, 
the emancipation of workmen; he showed them the en- 
larging structure, at the bottom the commune, above 
that the province, still higher the nation, and at the 



GERMINAL. 197 

top of all humanity. His arms were slowly extended, 
massing up the stories, uplifting the immense cathedral 
of the future world. Then came the interim admin- 
istration. He read the laws, spoke of congresses, the 
continual progress of the work, the enlarging of the 
programme which set out the discussion of salaries, 
attacking now the social liquidation so as to end with a 
higher salary. No more nationality, the workmen of 
the entire world would unite in a common wish for 
justice, sweeping away the rotten rulers, at last found- 
ing a free society where those who did not work could 
not reap. He cried out now; his breath seemed to 
frighten the very flowers under the smoky ceiling. 
They nodded their heads: some cried: 
'•That's true. . . . We're with you.'' 
He continued. Before three years the world would 
be conquered. Adherents poured in on all sides. No 
new religion ever had so many followers. Then, when 
they could be masters, they would dictate the law to 
their superiors, they should in their turn have their 
fists upon the others' throats. 
*'Yes, yes; they will fall." 

With a gesture he demanded silence. Now he was 
approaching the question of the strike. In principle 
he did not approve of what they had done, for that was 
a slow means which only aggravated more the sufferings 
of the workmen. Bat, on understanding that it was 
inevitable, they must make the best of it; they at least 
had the advantage of disorganizing the capital. And 
in that case he held up the International as a provi- 
dence for the strikers; he cited some examples: In 
Paris, at the time of the strike of the bronze workmen, 
the owners had suddenly agreed to all, seized with 
terror at the news that the International was sending 
aid; at London it had saved the coal men by sending 
back, at its own expense, a gang of men from Belgium, 
sent for by the mine-owners. It sufficed to win them 
over; the workmen entered into the grand army of 
workingmen, deciding to die for each other sooner than 
remain the slaves of a society of capitalists. 

Applause interrupted him. He wiped his face with 
his handkerchief, refusing the drink which Maheu 



198 GERMIÎirAL. 

passed him. When he wished to iiroceed new applause 
cut short his words. 

"It's all right," said he to Etienne. "Quick, hand 
me the cards." 

He plunged once more under the table and reappeared 
with the black case. 

" Citizens," cried he above all the noise, "here are 
the cards of membership. If your delegates will com.e 
forward I will give them up and they can distribute 
them. . . . Later on we will regulate all." 

Rasseneur arose to again protest. Etienne was agi- 
tated fearing he should be compelled to speak. An ex- 
treme confusion had come upon him. Levaque tlirew 
out his fists into the empty air as if hé was going to 
beat himself. Standing, Maheu was speaking without 
their being able to hear a single word. And Jouvar- 
ine at last interested, knocked on the table with both 
fists trying to assist Pluchart in obtaining silence. 

Suddenly the little door opened. Desir thundered 
forth: 

*' Be quiet for God's sake. Here are the gendarmes." 

It was the commissary of that district coming to 
break up the meeting. Four gendarmes accompanied 
him. For five minutes the old woman had kept them 
outside her door, saying that she had a right to enter- 
tain her friends. But they had thrown her aside and 
she had run to warn her children. 

" You can all go through here," she resumed. " There 
is a gendarme guarding the yard; that makes no differ- 
ence, my little woodshed leads into an alley, so make 
haste." 

The commissary was already rapping at the door with 
his fists, and when tliey would not open he threathened 
to break it in. 

In the hall the trouble was augmenting. They could 
not run away, they had not even voted either for the 
adhesion or the continuation of the strike. Every one 
tried to speak at once. Finally the president thought 
of a plan to vote by acclamation. Arms were raised, 
the delegates hastily declared they would adhere in the 
name of their absent comrades. And it was thus that 
the ten thousand coal men of Montson became members 
of the International, 



GERMINAL. 199 

In the meantime the flight had commenced. Protect- 
ing the retreat Desir leaned against the door while the 
gendarmes clubs shook her back. The miners jumped 
over the benches and flew through the kitchen and 
woodshed. Rasseneur was one of the first to disappear 
and Levaque following him forgot his anger so much as 
to offer him a drink. Etienne, after seizing hold of 
the little case, waited with Pluchart, Maheu and Jou- 
varine, who felt it was honorable to be the last to leave. 
When they left Desir turned the key and the commis- 
sary found himself in the presence of the old woman 
who was all alone. 

" You did a big thing, to break into my house, 
didn't you. You see there's no one here." 

The commissary, a slow man, who had become weary 
from some drinks he had been taking, simply threat- 
ened to put her in prison, and went off to draw up a 
report, turning around his four gendarmes, who were 
of no use to him now. Zacharie and Moquet, standing 
outside, laughed at this armed party. 

Outside, in the alley, Etienne, incommoded by the 
case, flew on, following the others. Suddenly he thought 
of Pierron. He asked why he had not been theie, and 
Maheu, still running, replied that he was ill — a good 
illness, the fear of compromising himself. They wished 
to detain Pluchart; but, without pausing, he declared 
that he must set out for Joiselle at once. Legoujeux 
was waiting there for orders. Then they wished him a 
pleasant journey, and did not slacken their speed, with 
arms swinging, all rushing from Montson. Some words 
were exchanged, intersected by their panting breath. 
" That has commenced to make progress," said Jouva- 
rine, amused at the departure of Rasseneur. Etienne 
and Maheu laughed with confidence, certain now of 
triumph, when the International should have sent them 
assistance. It would be the terrified company that, 
with clasped hands, would beg them to go back to work. 
And in that ray of hope, in that gallop of heavy shoes 
sounding upon the paved roads, there was another 
thing, something gloomy and fierce, a violence with 
which a breath had enfevered the alleys at the four 
corners of the country.

Another fifteenth glided by. The first days of 
January had come with u biting cold, which enveloped 
the great plain. In the alleys the misery was still 
increasing, people were sinking from hour to hour 
under the growing poverty. Two thousand francs sent 
from London by the International htnl not supplied 
them with bread for a day. After that they had re- 
ceived nothing but vague promises, of which the reali- 
zation was deferred from time to time. Their couiage 
failed them. What could they expect now, when their 
brothers had abandoned them? They were isolated 
from the world, deserted in the midst of the terrible 
winter. 

One Monday, when all resources had failed them, 
Etienne had vainly called the delegates together; they 
opened new subscriptions in all the neighboring towns, 
even in Paris they organized conferences; but the feeling 
which had at first prevailed settled down into a calm 
indifference, ^rhese few alms were hardly sufficient to 
sustain the poorest family. The others had lived by 
pawning their clothing and selling their furniture piece 
by ]uece. Everything went to the second-hand dealers, 
clothing, mattresses, kitchen utensils, even the chairs. 
Little by little the houses were emptied. Once they 
thought themselves saved, the little sliopkeepers, whose 
business had been ruined by Maigrat, offered everyone 
credit to try and bring back their custom, and, for a 
week Verdonck the grocer, the two butchers Canouble 
and Smelton, kept their shops open to all; but their 
advances were wasted, they were not able to continue. 
Bailiffs laughed at this, for it only resulted in a heap- 
ing up of debts, which for a long time would weigh on 
the miners. That ended all credit, even the sauce]ians 
were sold. They could lie in a corner and eat like 
dogs. 

Etienne had gone to Marchiennes and pawned his 
best pants and coat to make the pot of the Mahcu'sboil 
once more. Now nothing but the fine boots remained, 
which, he said, were kept to hold his feet firm. Kis

only regret was that the strike had began too soon be- 
fore the saving fund had grown large. In it was the 
cause of their disaster, for the working men would cer- 
tainly have triumphed over the owners if they had held 
the money necessary to exist some months. And he 
recalled the words of Jouvarine, who accused the com- 
pany of pushing on the strike to break up the saving 
fund. 

The sight of these poor people without bread and 
fire drove him to distraction. He i)referred turning his 
back on their misery, and wore himself out by long 
walks. One evening, on passing Requillart, he per- 
ceived near the old mine an old, fainting woman. 
Doubtless she was dying of hunger, and after having 
revived her, he called to a girl whom he saw on the 
other side of the fence. 

" It's you, is it?" said he, recognizing Moquette. 
"Help me, will you, we must make her drink some- 
thing.'" 

Moquette, crying from pity, ran into the house, their 
old liovel where the father was economically keeping 
himself in darkness. She immediately returned with 
some gin and a bit of bread. The drink revived the 
old woman, who, without speaking, greedily bit into the 
bread. It was the mother of a miner living in one of 
the alleys, and she had fallen there on her return from 
Joiselle, where she had vainly tried to borrow ten sous 
from a sister. After she had eaten she went off with 
faltering step. 

Etienne stood watching her retreating form. 

*' Won't you come in have a drink?" said Moquette. 

Then when he hesitated, she added: 

" Are you still afraid of me?" 

He followed her, won by her laugh. It touched him 
to see her give that bread with such a good heart. She 
did not wish to receive him in her father's room, so led 
him into her own little chamber and immediately 
poured out two glasses of gin. That room was very 
clean. He complimented her upon it. Her family did 
not seem to want for anything; the father continued 
his work of groom at the Voreux, and she, not wishing 
to live with folded arms, had taken in washing, at 
which she earned thirty sous a day. 



202 GERMINAL, 

** Say," murmured she suddenly, touching him on 
the back, " why can't you like me?" 

They both laughed at the coquettish remark. 

*' But I do like you very much," responded he. 

*'No, no; not like I want." 

It was true. For six months she had wished him to 
become her lover. He had noticed her following him, 
and now her face was I'aised to his in such a suppli- 
cating manner that he was touched by it. Her hirge, 
round face was not beautiful, with its yellow skiu f-pot- 
ted with coal, but her eyes shone like stars, and there 
was some charrn about her. 

When he left her she kissed his hands, grateful for 
the half hour spent with her. 

Etienne was a little ashamed of that visit, and on 
going away swore never to return. But he kept for her 
an amicable rememorance. She was a good girl. 

When he returned to the alley some news which he 
heard made him forget his adventure. It was said that 
the company might agree to a concession if the delegates 
were again to wait upon the directors. Some overseer 
had said this. The truth was, that in this fight the 
mine suffered still more than the miners. On botli sides 
obstinacy was costing them dear. While the workman 
died of hunger the capital was destroyed. Each day 
the mine was idle hundreds of thousands of francs were 
lost. Stopping ruins the machinery, tlie material and 
tools are spoiled, the money quietly melting away like 
water absorbed by the sand. For a week the miii^'s 
stock of coal had been exhausted, and the buyers, who 
spoke of sending to Belgium, made some dangerous 
comparisons between the tariffs in the two countries, 
which was a threat for the future. But that which 
especiall}' frightened the company, though it had been 
carefully hidden from every one, was the increasing 
ravages in the galleries and drifts. The overseers did not 
suffice, there were not enough men to do the propping 
which was needed. Very soon the disasters would 
become such that they would require long months of 
repairing. Throughout the country they were already 
telling that at Crevecoeur three hundred metres of the 
ceiling had caved in, blocking up the road to the vein 
Cinq-Paumes ; at La Madeleine the vein Maugretout 



GERMIXAL. 203 

was filled with water. The directors refused to acknowl- 
edge it, but suddenly two accidents, one following the 
other, confirmed the reports. One morning close to 
Polaine they found the ground outside of the top 
gallery bursting; the next day it gave way. The day 
following a corner of the Voreux sank so much that two 
houses nearly disappeared. 

Etienne and the delegates hesitated to risk another 
visit without knowing sometliing of the intentions of 
the owners. Dansaert, whom they questioned, avoided 
a positive answer. Certainly, they deplored the mis- 
understanding; they would do anything in the world to 
come to some definite agreement. Then they decided 
to return to M. Hennebeau, thus showing their reason- 
ableness; for they did not wish later on to be accused of 
having given the company no chance to admit being in 
the wrong. Only they swore to yield to nothing but 
their own conditions which were the only just ones. 
This second step would affirm their right and wisdom. 

The interview took place on Tuesday morning. It 
was less cordial than the first. Maheu again spoke, ex- 
plaining that the comrades had sent him to ask if those 
gentlemen had anything new to say to them. At first 
M. Hennebeau affected surprise, answering that no 
order had reached him, that things could not change 
as long as the miners were headstrong in their detestable 
revolt, and that stiffness of authority produced the most 
unpleasant effect, and if they had arrived there with 
good intentions the way in which they v/ere received 
would have sufficed to make them mors obstinate. 
Finally the director wished a mutual concession; for 
example, the workmen should accept the payment of 
the woodwork in part, while the company would increase 
that payment the two centimes of which the men 
accused it of profiting. He added that he took that 
upon himself, as nothing was as yet decided, but he 
flattered himself to be able to obtain that concession. 
But the delegates refused and repeated their demands: 
A return to the old system with an increase of five cen- 
times per car. Then he admitted that he could treat 
with them at once; he pressed them to accept in the 
name of the wives and children who were dying of hun- 
ger. With eyes on the ground, and a determined air 



304 GEKMIKAL. 

they still said no^ no. They separated in anger. M. 
Hennebeau slammed the door after them. Etienne, 
Maheu and the others went off, stamping with their 
heavy heels on the sidewalk, in the silent rage of men 
pushed to a last extremity. 

At two o'clock the women in the alley attempted a 
last appeal to Maigrat. It was an idea of la Maheu's 
who too often counted on the good heart of people. 
La Brule and la Levaque decided to accompany her, 
but la Pierronne excused herself, saying she was not 
able to leave Pierron, who had not yet recovered. Other 
women joined the company, there were about twenty 
in all. When the rich people of Montson saw them 
coming along the gloomy road, they raised their heads 
with uneasiness, closing their doors and locking up 
their silver. At Maigrat's there was a violent scene. 
He had invited them to enter, laughingly asking them 
if they had come to pay their debts? Then when la 
Maheu began talking, he became angry. What did 
she take him for? More credit? no; not a potatoe, not 
a mite of bread, and he told them to go to the grocer 
Verdonck, to the butchers Canouble and Smelton. The 
women listened to him with a frightened air, excusing 
themselves. But he pushed them toward the door. 
When they insisted he became brutal. After reaching 
the pavement they still entreated him, while la Maheu, 
in a burst of revengeful indignation, raised both arms 
above her head asking that he might be struck dead, 
for such a man should not live. 

The return to the alley was one of sadness. When the 
wives came in with empty hands, the men looked at 
them in silence. It was done, the day would end with- 
out a mouthful to eat, and the days to come stretched out 
like icy shadows from which not a hope stood forth. 
But no one spoke of yielding. That great misery 
rendered them all the more obstinate, like beasts driven 
into a hole who would die rather than come forth. 
Who would have dared be the first to speak of submis- 
sion? They had sworn to keep together, and a man 
would as soon have thought of leaving his comrades 
buried beneath the ground in a cave-in as to desert them 
now. That was their duty, the mine with its toils and 
privations was a good school in which to learn résigna- 



GERMINAL. 205 

tion and patience; they could easily stand hunger for 
eight days when they had gone through fire and water 
since the age of twelve years; and like soldiers, proud 
of their calling, they strove against death, making no 
boast of the sacrifice. 

At Maheu's, that evening was a terrible one. They 
were all silently seated before the dying fire in which 
smoked the last piece of wood. After having emptied 
the room piece by piece, the evening before they had 
decided to sell the clock, and now without its familiar 
tic-tac the house seemed naked and dead. On the 
cupboard remained no other ornament than the paste- 
board box, an old gift of Maheu's which his wife had 
kept as if it was a jewel. The two good chairs were 
gone; Bonnemort and the little ones were seated upon 
an old mossy bench brought in from the garden. And 
the falling shadows seemed to increase the cold. 

"What shall we do ?" said the mother, crouching in 
a corner, near the stove. 

Etienne stood looking at the pictures of the Emperor 
and Empress hanging against the wall. He would have 
sold them a long time before, but the family could not 
part with them. 

"Just think, we could get two sous for that foolish- 
ness which is watching us starve." 

" Suppose I sell the box," said the wife, after hesi- 
tating for a moment. 

But Maheu, seated on the edge of the table, his legs 
swinging and head bent over, suddenly straightened 
himself up. 

" No." 

Slowly the wife arose and walked around the room. 
Why did God allow them to be reduced to such misery, 
without a crust, and nothing left to sell ? The fire 
was going out, also. She grew angry at Alzire, whom 
she had sent out that morning to pick up cinders, but 
the child had returned empty-handed, saying they had 
chased her away from the mine. Could the company 
be so hard on them as not to allow the little ones to 
pick up the bits of worthless coal ? 

"And that fool of a Jeanlin !" cried the mother. 
" Where can he be ? He ought to bring us some dan- 
delions ; we could have eaten them, anyhow. You see. 



206 GERMINAL. 

he doesn't come home. He staid ont all last night, 
and tlie rogue always acts as if he had plenty to eat." 

" Perhaps he begs on the roads/' said Etienne. 

She became almost frantic. 

" Great heavens ! if I knew that ! . . . My 
children beggars ! I'd rather they'd kill themselves, 
and me too." 

Lenore and Henri, astonished at having nothing to 
eat, began to moan, while Bonnemort silently rolled his 
tongue in his mouth in order to deceive his hunger. 
Not a word was spoken. The aggravated troubles 
stunned them all. The grandfather coughed, and 
again spit black. His rheumatism was now turning to 
dropsy. 

Then, in the shadows shrouding this room, filled 
with mournful sadness, Etienne, who had hesitated for 
an instant, decided with heart nearly bursting: 

"Wait; I'm going somewhere," said he. 

And he went. He had thought of Moquette. She 
must have a loaf of bread, and she would willingly give 
it to him. It made him angry to be forced to return to 
Kequillart, but he could not leave his friends in trouble. 
He would still be kind to her if it was necessary. 

''I'll go and look, too," said the wife. It's too foolish 
to sit here." 

She again opened the door .and went off behind the 
young man, leaving the other occupants of the room 
silent and still in the faint light from the end of a 
candle which Alzire had just lit. Outside the woman 
paused a moment reflecting, then she entered Levaque's 
house. 

" I lent you a loaf of bread the other day. Can't you 
give it back to me?" 

But she stopped, seeing but little encouragement. 
That house was in worse misery than her own. La 
Levaque, with a stony glare, sat before her dying fire, 
while Levaque, who had become intoxicated with some 
nailmakers, was lying asleep upon the table. Bouteloup 
leaned against the wall looking at this scene of desola- 
tion with dismay. 

"A loaf of bread from me? "answered la Levaque. 
"Why, I was just going to borrow another some- 
where." 



GERMINAL. 207 

Then when her husband groaned in his sleep, she 
beat his face against the table. 

" Shut up, pig. Instead of letting your friends pay 
for your drink, you'd better asked them to lend you 
twenty sous." 

She continued her complaints. Her son, that fool of 
a Bebert, had also been away since morning, and she 
cried that it would be a good riddance if he never came 
back. Then she declared she was going to bed. She 
could at least be warm there. 

And telling Bi^uteloup that it was not worth while to 
light the candle only to see the empty plates, she 
started for the stairs, yelling: 

"That drunkard can freeze if he likes." 

"When she was again outside, la Maheu resolutely cut 
across the gardens on her way to Pierron's house. She 
knocked, but there was a sudden silence. After a little 
time the door was opened. 

"■It's you, is it?" said la Pierronne, affecting surprise. 
" I thought it was the doctor." 

And not giving her a chance to speak, she continued, 
as she turned toward Pierron, seated before a great coal 
fire: 

"He's sick; he's always sick, though he looks 
healthy. He must be kept warm, so I'm burning all I 
have." 

Pierron seemed very well; his complexion was florid, 
and he was quite fat — but he breathed slowly to appear 
ill. But on entering, la Maheu had smelt a strong 
odor of rabbit. They must have cleared off the table; 
some crumbs were on the floor, and she suddenly per- 
ceived a bottle of wine that had been forgotten. 

"Mother has gone to Montson to try and get a loaf of 
bread," resumed the daughter. "We're afraid to see 
her come back for fear she brings none." 

But her voice trembled. She had followed the glance 
of her neighbor and her eyes fell on the bottle. But she 
composed herself immediately, saying it was some wine 
the rich man of Piolaine had brought there for her 
husband, for whom the doctor had ordered claret. And 
she was lavish in her thanks. What good people, 
especially the young lady, they were; not proud, for 



208 GERMINAL. 

they came to the workmen's houses and distributed their 
own alms. 

"I know/' said La Maheu, — "I know them." 

Her heart was bursting at the thought that the most 
was always given to the least poor. That was always the 
way. These peoj^le of Piolaine would carry water to the 
river. How was it she had not seen them in the alley? 
Perhaps they would have given her something. 

"^I came/' said she at last, "to know if there was no 
more food at your house than at oui-s. Have you a little 
vermicelli to lend me?" 

La Pierronne noisily replied. 

"We have nothing at all, my dear; not even a grain 
of semoule. Mother has not come back, and if she 
hasn't succeeded we'll have to go supperless to bed." 

Just then the sound of tears came from the cellar, 
accompanied by blows on the door. It was Lydie, who 
was shut up, she said, to punish her for not coming in 
until five o'clock, after running the roads for a whole 
day. They had no control over her. 

La Maheu still remained standing, dreading to 
leave. That fire penetrated her with a sad warmth. 
The thought that they had been eating only made her 
hunger the keener. They had evidently sent away the 
old woman, shut the little one up, to stuff themselves 
with their rabbit. 

" Good evening," said she, suddenly. 

The moon, occasionally peeping from behind the 
clouds, shone on the ground with a pale light. Instead 
of again crossing the gardens, la Maheu walked on, 
fearing to enter her house. What good to knock at 
other doors ? they were all as miserable as she. In the 
weeks that they had been slovv'ly starving, even the odor 
of onions had left the alleys, that strong odor v.hich 
could be detected a long distance in the country. Oc- 
casional sounds were heard, — stifled tears mingled with 
oaths. But little by little a silence fell, broken only 
by the moans of these half-famished people, who even in 
sleep could not forget their hunger. 

As she passed the church, she saw a shadow rapidly 
disappearing. A faint hope induced her to hasten on, 
for she had recognized the Cure of Montson, the Abbe 
Joire, who said mass at the chapel on Sunday. He was 



GERMINAL. 20y 

coming from the vestry. Some clerical duties had 
called him. With bent back, he still hurried on; a 
fat, jolly man, desirous of living at peace with all the 
world. She comprehended why he had come there in 
the night ; he did not wish to compromise himself with 
the miners. They said he was shortly to be transferred 
to a larger town, and he was now with his successor, a 
thin man with very red eyes. 

"Monsieur le Cure; Monsieur le Cure I" called la 
Maheu. 

But he did not stop. 

"Good evening, my good woman." 

When she again reached her own door her limbs 
would carry her no further, and she entered. 

No one had stirred. Maheu was still on the edge of 
the table, old Bonnemort and the little ones huddled 
together on the bench trying to keep warm. The piece 
of candle had burned so low that even their light would 
soon leave them. As the door opened the children 
turned their heads, but on seeing the mother had 
brought back nothing their eyes were again lowered, 
while they kept back a great wish to cry for fear of be- 
ing scolded. The mother fell back into her old place 
near the stove, in which now scarcely a spark remained. 
They asked no questions, the silence had not been 
broken. All comprehended they thought it useless to 
fatigue themselves more by talking, and utterly crushed 
they waited on for the aid which Etienne miglit bring 
them. The minutes v/ent by and a death-like coldness 
came on. 

When Etienne arrived he had in a cloth a dozen cold 
baked potatoes. 

"Kerens all I've found," said he. 

At Moquette's the bread had also given out, and 
she had insisted on his carrying off her dinner, kissing 
him with all her heart. 

" Thanks," said he to la Maheu, who offered him 
her share; "I've eaten." 

It was untrue, and with a gloomy air he watched the 
children throw themselves on the food. The father and 
mother held back to leave more for the others, but the 
old man greedily swallowed all. They were obliged to 
take a potato away from Alzire. In three minutes 



210 GEEMINAL. 

the table was clear. They looked at each other, still 
Yery hungry. 

Then Etienne said that he had learned some news. 
The company, irritated at the obstinacy of the strikers, 
was going to discharge all the workmen compromised. 
It was war to the death. But a still more grave report 
was circulated. They were boasting that a number of the 
miners had decided to begin work again on the follow- 
ing day. The Victorie and Feutry-Cantel would be 
almost complete; that would even have some gangs of 
workmen at the Miron and Madeleine. The Maheus 
were exasperated. 

"Great heavens!" cried the father. '*If they are 
traitors we must settle with them." 

And standing up, yielding to the rage from his suffer- 
ings, he screamed. 

"Tomorrow evening in the forest! . . . If they 
can prevent us from hearing each other at the Bon- 
Joyeux, we're at home in the forest." 

That cry awakened old Bonnemort, whose gluttony 
had overcome him. It was the old rallying cry, the 
place of meeting where the miners in old times went to 
plot their resistance to the soldiers of the king. 

•' Yes, yes, at Vandame," said he. *^I^m with them 
if they go there." 

The wife threw out her arms. 

*' We'll all go. That'll end this injustice and this 
betraying." 

Etienne decided that the whole alley should be noti- 
fied of the meeting which would take place the following 
evening. But the fire was dead, and the candle sud- 
denly went out. There was no more coal and no more 
oil; they were forced to grope their way up to bed in 
the intense cold, from which the children were crying. 



CHAPTER XXII. 



Jeanlin was now able to walk, but, though he ran 
as fast as ever, he waddled like a duck. 

That evening at dusk, upon the Requillart road, the 
boy, accompanied by his inseparable companions, Lydie 



GEKMINAL. 211 

and Bebert, was begging. He was biding bebind a 
fence in front of a small grocery sbop. An old blind 
woman had for sale there four sacks of beans black with 
dust; an old dry codfish hung before the door and the 
child watched it with his small eyes. Twice he had 
sent Bebert to steal it, but each time someone had ap- 
peared on the road. 

First came a gentleman on horseback, and the chil- 
dren threw themselves down close to the fence on recog- 
nizing M. Hennebeau. Since the strike they often saw 
him traveling alone on the roads and through the alleys, 
filled with rebellious people, with a sort of tranquil 
courage, trying to see for himself the state of the coun- 
try. JSTot a stone whizzed past his ear; he only met a 
few silent men who were slow to salute him. 

" Thank goodness he's gone," said Jeanlin. " Go on 
now, Bebert ; pull it down by the tail." 

But two men were now coming along the road, and 
the boy stifled an oath as he heard the voice of his 
brother Zacharie telling Moquet he had found four sous 
concealed in his wife's skirt. Both laughed at this, 
slapping each other on the back. Moquet told the 
other they would have a good game of cricket the next 
day. They would start from Easseneur's and go over 
near Marchiennes to play. They were about to turn the 
corner of the road when Etienne, who was coming from 
the canal, stopped and spoke with them. 

"Goodness sakes!" resumed Jeanlin, exasperated, 
" we don't want to stay here forever. It's getting dark, 
and the old woman will take the things in." 

Another miner was walking down toward Requillart. 
Etienne stopped him, and as they passed the fence the 
children heard them speaking of the forest. They had 
been compelled to postpone the meeting one day longer, 
so as to communicate with all the people. 

" Say now," whispered the boy to his comrades, " did 
you hear that? We must be there. We'll go in the 
afternoon, too." 

Then, as the road was at last clear, he pushed Bebert 
forward. 

" Go on now, and look out for the old woman's 
broom." 

Happily it had grown dark. Bebert, with a bound, 



212 GERMINAL. 

seized the codfish, the string of which broke, and flew 
off like a deer, followed by the two others. The woman, 
in astonishment, ran from the shop, but could not dis- 
tinguish those forms fast disappearing in the darkness. 

These youngsters had become the terror of the whole 
country, which they had invaded little by little like a 
band of savages. At first they were content to play 
in the Voreux coal-yards, from which they emerged 
looking like negroes; then they went to the old mine, 
where they would spend an entire day at play; then 
they ran through the meadows, eating all sorts of herbs, 
without bread, and catching fish on the banks of the 
canal, which were eaten raw; then they went as far as 
the forest of Vandame, where in the spring they filled 
themselves with wild strawberries, and in winter gath- 
ered nuts and myrtle; and shortly they explored the 
whole plain. 

But their motive in thus running the roads from 
Montson to Marchiennes, casting their eyes all around 
like young wolves searching for prey, was to steal. Jean- 
lin was captain of these expeditions, sending the chil- 
dren after all sorts of plunder, ravaging the onion 
fields, breaking into the orchards, and attacking the 
shop windows. In the country the miners, who were 
on the strike, were accused of all this. One day this 
boy had even forced Lydie to rob her mother; he had 
made her bring him two dozen bars of rock candy, 
which la Pierronne kept in a jar on one of the shelves 
of her window; and the cunning child did not betray 
him; she trembled with fear before him. The worst of 
it all was, he always took the lion's share for himself. 
Bebert was compelled to give up all his spoils to him, 
and was happy if his ears were not boxed when he 
asked for a share. 

For some time Jeanlin had been accustomed to beat 
Lydie, and he ruled Bebert with a rod of iron, though 
the latter, who was much larger and stronger than he, 
could have killed him with a blow from his fist. He 
despised them both, treating them like slaves, telling 
them he had a home which was so unearthly that he 
could not take them to it; and, in truth, at times he 
would disappear at a turn in the road, ordering them to 



GERMINAL. 213 

go back to the alley. But first he would put all the 
spoils in his pocket. This was what happened that night. 

" Give it to me," said he, snatching the codfish from 
his comrade, when they had all stopped at a bend m the 
road near Eequillart. 

Bebert protested. 

*'I want it. You know I took it." 

**What!" said he. ''You'll have some if I choose to 
give it to you — not to-night, though. If there's any left 
to-morrow I'll see about it." 

He stood them in a line like soldiers on drill, then 
passed behind them. 

"Now, you're to stay there five minutes, without 
turning round. If you do turn, some beasts will eat you. 
And after that you're to go straight home." 

Then he disappeared in the shadows, so lightly that 
they did not even hear the sound of his feet. The two 
children remained motionless for five minutes, without 
daring to turn their heads for fear of receiving a blow 
from some invisible person. Gradually a great affection 
had risen between them in their mutual terror. When 
the limited time was over they slowly moved away 
through the darkness toward the alley. 

At that hour Etienne had also entered Eequillart. 
The day before Moquette had begged him to come 
back, and he complied with her request, not able to 
resist the pleading looks of that girl who loved him 
better than her God. It must be broken up, he said to 
himself ; he would see her and explain that she must 
follow him no more, on account of his comrades. It 
was not right to be thus making love, when people were 
dying of hunger. She was not at home when he ar- 
rived, but he decided to wait for her at the old mine. 

Beneath the ruined tower the old shaft was half 
covered up. A beam, which supported a piece of the 
roofing, looked like a gallows above some black hole ; 
and two trees, a sorb and a platane, which had par- 
tially fallen into the hole, seemed to spring from the 
bottom of the earth. It was a corner of savage aban- 
don, filled with old hawthorn and sloe-trees, which the 
birds filled with their nests in spring time. To avoid 
the great expense ot keeping it in repair, the company 
had for some time proposed to fill in that old mine. 



214 GERMINAL. 

but they desired first to establish at the Voreux a ven- 
tilating furnace, in place of the old one at Eequillart, 
which had been used for airing both shafts. They had 
joined the tubbing and abandoned the upper gallery, so 
as to utilize only the gallery at the bottom, in which 
flamed an enormous brazier of coal, with a draft so 
powerful, that the air blew like a tempest from one 
side to the other of the neighboring mine. Orders 
were given to keep the ladders in repair as far as the 
furnace, which was at five hundred and twenty-five 
metres from the top ; but as no attention was paid to 
the command, they had been rotted by the dampness, 
and some rungs had already given way. The entrance 
was blocked up by a large rock, and as' the first ladder 
had lost its rungs it was necessary to let oneself down 
by the roots of the sorb-tree, then fall, come what might, 
into the darkness. 

Etienne was concealed behind a bush when he heard 
a rustling among the branches. He thought it the 
frightened flight of a snake. But the sudden light 
from a match astonished him, and he was stupefied on 
seeing, a short distance off, Jeanlin light a candle and 
then disappear in the ground. A sudden curiosity 
seized him and he glided to the edge of the hole. The 
boy was lost to sight, but a faint light came from the 
second ladder. An instant he hesitated, then dropped 
through the opening, feeling a rung break beneath his 
feet. He commenced to descend quietly. Jeanlin 
could not have heard him, for Etienne still saw the 
shadow sinking down while the little one's long waver- 
ing shadow danced with the limping of his infirm 
limbs. He descended like a monkey, holding on with 
his hands, feet and chin when the rungs failed. The 
ladders, seven metres in length, followed one another, 
some still solid, while others shook and cracked as 
though they would fall apart; the landing-places had 
become so green that he felt as though he was walking 
on moss; and as they went down the heat became ter- 
rible, a furnace-like heat from the ventilating room, 
which, happily, was not much used since the strike, for 
when the mine was going they would have been roasted 
there. 



GERMIKAL. 215 

"Where is the young villain going?" thought 
Etienne, suffocated. 

Twice he had nearly fallen head over heels, his feet 
slipping upon the damp wood. If he only had a can- 
dle like the child! He hit himself every moment, not 
being guided by the vague light beneath him. He 
reached the twentieth ladder and the descent still con- 
tinued. Then he counted them aloud, twenty-one, 
twenty-two, twenty-three, and still deeper down. He 
was becoming giddy from the heat ; he felt as though 
he was falling into a furnace. At last, on arriving at 
a level, he perceived the candle going on at the end of 
one of the galleries. Tliirty ladders; that was about 
two hundred and ten metres. 

But the road on the left, which led to the stables, 
was blocked by a cave-in. The journey was becoming 
more painful and more dangerous. Frightened bats 
flew out from the arches of the drifts. He was com- 
pelled to hasten, so as not to lose sight of the light. He 
kept in the same gallery, but where the child glided 
along at his ease, with the suppleness of a serpent, he 
could not slip through without bruising his limbs. 
Those galleries, like all old roads, were being brought 
closer and closer together each day by the continual 
pressure of the rocks, and now in certain places there 
was nothing but a gut, which in the end would be alto- 
gether closed. He was constantly in peril from the 
broken timbers, which threatened to run splinters into 
him as sharp as swords. Advancing with caution, 
stooping almost to his knees, he groped his way along 
in the darkness. Suddenly a number of rats flew at 
him, running down his back in fright. 

" Great heavens ! here we are at last," he groaned, 
with limbs half broken, and out of breath. 

They had arrived. At the end of a kilometre the 
tunnel enlarged as they came out into a piece of the 
road admirably preserved. It was the old car road, 
which had been cut through the rock and was like to a 
natural grotto. He stopped, seeing the child, some 
metres off, place his candle between two stones, and 
then seat himself with the air of a man happy to have 
at last reached home. That end of the gallery had 
been changed into quite a comfortable dwelling ; on 



216 GE-RMINAL. 

the ground, in one corner, a heap of hay made a Boft 
couch ; upon a table, made from pieces of old woocZ, 
was quite a collection of articles, — bread, candles and 
bottles of gin as yet unopened. It was a real robber's 
cavern. The spoils had been accumulating for weeks, 
and among them were even useless things, such as bars 
of wax, stolen for the pleasure of stealing. The boy 
surveyed this plunder with the joyous air of an egotis- 
tical brigand. 

"So this is your hole, is it ?" said Etienne, after 
breathing a moment. " You come down here to take 
your ease, while we're dying of hunger above." 

Jeanlin tremblingly started. But on recognizing the 
young man he regained his composure. 

" Will you dme with me ? " said he. " Just a piece 
of broiled cod. I'll show it to you." 

He had not lost his codfish, and he sat down to pre- 
pare it with a beautiful new knife, — one of those dagger- 
knives with a bone handle on which a device is inscribed. 
On this one was simply the word 'Love.' 

** You have a pretty knife," remarked Etienne. 

'' It's a gift from Lydie," responded Jeanlin, who 
neglected to add that the girl had stolen it on his order 
from a stand in Montson placed before the Tete- Coupee. 

Then, still scraping the fish, he added with a fierce 
air: 

"Ain't I well off here! It's a little warmer than up 
there." 

Etienne had seated himself, anxious to make him 
talk. He was not angry, but began to feel an interest 
in that terrible child, so brave and so industrious in 
his vice. And it was really very comfortable in that 
hole; it was no longer too warm, an even temperature 
reigned there, with the moist, pleasant air of a bath- 
room, while above the rough winter blasts almost froze 
the miserable people. On growing old the galleries had 
been purified of the bad gases; all the fire-damp had 
departed; they only smelt the odor of the old mouldy 
wood. That wood, however, was interesting to look at; 
it was of a palish yellow hue, partially covered with 
mushrooms, while white butterflies, bees and flies made 
their home there among the white cobwebs. A pop- 
ulation without color, ignorant of the sun. 



GEIÎMINAL. 217 

"Then you're not afraid?" asked Etienne. 

Jeanlin looked at him in astonishment. 

" Afraid of what? When I'm all alone? " 

But the fish was scraped at last. He lit a little wood 
fire, evened it off, and started to boil his cod. Then he 
cut a loaf of bread in two. It was a terribly dirty re- 
past, but good, all the same. Etienne accepted his 
portion. 

" I'm not astonished now that you're growing fat, 
while the others become lean. Don't you know it is 
wicked to steal? And don't you ever think of the 
others?" 

*' What makes the others so stupid? " 

*' You should break yourself of stealing; for if your 
father learned that you stole he'd fix you." 

" Don't the rich people steal from us? You've always 
said so. When I grabbed that loaf of bread from Mai- 
grat it was surely one that he owed us." 

The young man was silent, with mouth full. He 
looked at that boy, with his little nose, green eyes and 
large ears, who had the cunning and craft of a fox. 
This mine would end by breaking his limbs, though. 

" And Lydie," asked Etienne; " do you bring her 
here sometimes?" 

Jeanlin laughed. 

"The little one; ah, no indeed! . . . Women 
talk too much." 

And he continued to laugh, filled with great disdain 
for Lydie and Bebert. There never were such stupid 
children. The thought that they believed all his sto- 
ries, and went off with empty hands while he ate the 
codfish, made him laugh. Then he concluded, with the 
gravity of a little philosopher: 

" It's better to be alone. Y'ou're sure to get along 
well then." 

Etienne finished his bread and drank a swallow of 
gin. He asked himself if it would not be acknowledg- 
ing the hospitality of Jeanlin badly to lead him off by 
the ear and report him to his father. But on examin- 
ing this profound retreat a thought came to him; how 
did he know that he would not need it for his comrades, 
or himself even, in case things went wrong above. He 
made the boy swear not to go to bed; for he sometimes 



218 GERMINAL. 

forgot himself and went to sleep in the hay; and tak- 
ing one of the candles he went off, leaving Jeanlin to 
arrange his house in peace. 

Moquette, seated on a log, had just begun to despair 
of seeing him. When she perceived the young man 
she threw herself on his neck, and it was as if he had 
thrust a knife into her heart when he told her he 
should see her no more. Oh God! did she not love him 
enough? Not wishing to enter tlie house with her he 
drew her off toward the road explaining, in the kindest 
way possible, that she would compromise him in the 
eyes of his comrades and in the cause of politics. She 
thought he was ashamed of her; but that did not wound 
her; it was very natural that he should be, and she 
offered to allow him to beat her, so that people would 
think he did not wish to have anything to do with her. 
But he would see her again, if only once in a while, 
wouldn't he? In a state of distraction she plead with 
him; she would keep out of his way at all other times, 
if he would only come to see her for five minutes now 
and then. He, though very much disturbed, still re- 
fused. He must do so. Step by step they had arrived 
as far as the first houses of Montson, and, standing 
beneath the big round moon, they were in each other's 
arms when a woman, passing close to them, gave a 
sudden start, as if she had knocked against a stone, 

"Who was that?" asked Etienne, uneasily. 

"It was Catherine," replied Moquette, "She's on 
her way home from Jean-Bart." 

The woman had gone on with limbs feeble and head 
down, as though very weary. The young man looked 
after her, desperate at having been seen by her, his 
heart bursting with a remorse which had no cause. 
Was she not living with a man? Had she not made him 
suffer with the same suffering, there upon that road to 
Kequillart? But, in spite of all that, it drove him wild 
to have done the same to her. 

"If you don't want me, it's because you want some 
one else," said Moquette, as she left him with tears in 
her eyes. 

The next day the weather was superb — a clear sky, 
though freezing cold, — one of those beautiful days of 
December when the hard earth sounds like glass under 



GERMINAL. 219 

the feet. At one o'clock Jeanlin started out, but he 
was obliged to wait behind the church for Bebert. 
Lydic's mother had given her a basket and told her if 
she did not bring it back full of dandelions they would 
shut her up with the rats for the entire night. So, 
filled with fear, she wanted to go to the meadows at 
once, but Jeanlin made her start off with them, saying 
they could see about that later on. For a long time 
Easseneur's great Pologne had been worrying him. As 
he passed the Voreux the rabbit started out on the 
road. He seized it by the ears, flung it in Lydic's 
basket, and all three children ran off. They could have 
lots of fun with it, making it run after them like a dog, 
as far as the forest. 

But they stopped to watch Zacharie and Moquet, 
who, after taking a drink with two other comrades, 
began their game of cricket. The prize, a new cap 
and red silk handkerchief, was deposited with Easse- 
neur. The four players commenced the game at the 
first turn from the Yoreux to the Paillot farm. In 
opening the game Zacharie started by betting seven 
knocks, while Moquet demanded eight. They placed 
the cholette, a little wooden egg, on the ground, 
with the point standing up ; then laid hold of their 
mallets. Two o'clock struck as they began. Zacharie, 
with the first strike, sent the cholette more than four 
hundred metres across the fields. This game was for- 
bidden to be played in the villages for fear of accidents. 

But the game went on, and, as they ran, their feet 
were bruised by the frozen pieces of ploughed ground. 

At first Jeanlin, Bebert and L3'dic enthusiastically 
watched the players. Then they thought of Pologne, 
still in the basket, and they drew him out, curious to 
see if he could run fast. The rabbit ran away, with 
the children following after. For one hour they chased 
it, yelling as loud as they could to frighten it, quickly 
opening their arms and closing them again on empty 
air. 

Suddenly a volley of oaths made them turn; tliey had 
again fallen upon the cricket party. It was Zacharie 
who was swearing at having nearly split his brother's 
skull. The players were now at their fourth turn, they 
had made two leagues and a half in an hour and had 



230 GERMINAL. 

stopped to drink at le Vincet and a place called le 
Trois-Sages. Moquet still had two knocks left to him, 
and his victory was sure, when Zacharie laughingly 
batted with all his strength and the cholette rolled into 
a deep ditch. Moquet's partner could not get it out; 
this was a disaster. All became angry, for they were 
neck to neck and they would have to commence again. 
Then they concluded to refresh themselves at Lerenard's. 

Jeanlin had a new idea. He let them start, and then 
he took a string from his pocket which he tied to 
one of Pologne's legs, the left hind one. It was very 
amusing ; the rabbit ran behind the three childern, 
limping in a most lamentable manner. Finally they 
tied the string to its neck, and when it grew tired they 
dragged it along upon its back. This lasted for more 
than an hour and it was almost dead, when they quickly 
put it back in the basket on hearing the players return- 
ing to their game. 

Poor Zacharie, Moquet, and the two others, played on 
without other rest than a moment here and there to 
drink in all the saloons which they frequented. The 
hard ground resounded with their heavy feet as they 
ran on at the risk of breaking their limbs. In the dry 
air the heavy blows of the mallet rang out. The mus- 
cular hands grasped the handles, while they exerted 
their muscles with strength enough to slay an ox. For 
this game, strong and vigorous chests, with supple 
joints, were necessary. At four o'clock, tired out, they 
paused in their game. 

The clocks struck five ; it was already dusk ; but they 
wanted one more turn to see who won the cap and 
handkerchief ; and Zacharie jokingly said, with his in- 
difference to politics, that it would be jolly to go down 
and see the fun. 

As for Jeanlin, since the departure of the people in 
the alleys, he had struck out for the forest. With an 
indignant gesture, he threatened Lydie, who was taken 
with remorse, and spoke of going back to gather 
dandelions, Would she go and leave everything? It 
would be too funny to hear what the old people would 
have to say. He pushed Bebert along, proposing to en- 
liven the walk by letting out Pologne and beating her 
with pebbles; his hidden motive was to torture her to 



GERMINAL. 231 

death, and then he could carry her away and eat her in 
his hole at Requillart. The rabbit started off with head 
down and ears np. One stone skinned her back, an- 
other her tail, and, in spite of the increasing shadows, 
she would have been killed, had not the children per- 
ceived Etienne and Jourvarine standing near them. 
They quickly threw themselves upon the rabbit, putting 
her back into the basket. At that moment Zacharie, 
Moquet and the others came up. Since dusk, in the 
entire country, through all the roads and paths over 
the plain, a silent procession of shadows moved on to- 
ward the forest. Every alley was deserted. Even the 
women and children started out under that clear sky. 
Now that the roads had become obscure, one could no 
longer distinguish those marching forms who were all 
making for the same goal. Along the bushes there 
was a slight rustle, while through the trees came a 
vague sound of voices in the night. 

M, Hennebeau, riding along on his horse, listened to 
all these sounds. He had met some couples, but 
thought them merely lovers out for a walk on that 
beautiful winter's night ; and with bent head he rode 
on, envying these miserable people. 



CHAPTER XXIII. 



At the Plan-des-Dames, a large clearing had been 
made by the felling of trees. A smooth slope, inclosed 
by a high hedge, extended for some distance. 

Through the whole forest of Vandame were scattered 
superb beech-trees, while a number of giant stumps 
arose from the dead grass, and toward the left a heap 
of cut timber was arranged in regular order. As night 
came on, the cold increased ; the frozen moss cracked 
under the footsteps. It was very dark ; the high 
branches reached far up in the pale sky, shutting out 
from view the full moon and little twinkling stars. 

Almost three thousand people were at the rendez- 
vous ; a swarming crowd of men, women and children 
gradually filling the clearing, standing in groups under 
the distant trees, while the late comers, still arriving. 



223 GERMINAL. 

added to the line of shadows spreading out as far as the 
hedge. In that still and frozen forest, a dull, rumbling 
sound went up like the wind of an approaching thunder- 
storm. 

Etienne, Easseneur and Jouvarine were standing on 
the hill overlooking the slope. A quarrel arose, to 
which the men standing near were attentively listening; 
Maheu in gloomy silence, Levaque with his hands 
closed, Pierron turning his back in despair at being no 
longer able to simulate a fever ; and there was also 
Bonnemort and Moque seated side by side upon a 
stump engaged in meditating. In the background 
were Zacharie, Moquet and some others, who were there 
only for sport, while on the other side a number of 
women were gathered, looking as solemn as though 
they were at church; Maheu's wife as quiet as he, shak- 
ing her head at the oaths uttered by Levaque. 

Philomene was coughing, having been troubled all 
winter with bronchitis. Moquette was laughing, show 
ing her beautiful teeth, amused at the manner in which- 
le Brule treated her daughter, an unnatural child who 
had sent the mother away while she stuffed herself with 
rabbit and who had a coward for a husband. Jeanlm 
had pushed Lydie upon the top of the woodpile, leav- 
ing Bebert to follow them, and these three children 
high up in the air looked down on the people beneath 
them. 

The quarrel was commenced by Rasseneur, who 
wished to proceed regularly by the election of a bureau. 
His overthrow at the Bon-Joyeux had enraged him and 
he swore to be revenged, flattering himself his old au- 
thority would return when he was before the whole 
mining people. Etienne rebelled, thinking a bureau 
foolish in that forest. It was necessary to act like sav- 
ages when they dealt with blockheads. Seeing no end 
to the dispute, the young man suddenly took possession 
of the crowd by springing on the trunk of a tree 
and crying out : 

"Comrades! comrades!" 

The confused noise of those people ended in a long 
sigh, while Jouvarine stopped the protestations of Ras- 
seneur. Etienne continued in a low voice: 

*' Comrades, when they forbid us to speak, when they 



GEEMIÎfAL. 223 

send the gendarmes after us as if we were robbers, it is 
necessary for us to sustain each other. Here we are free, 
we are at home; none can compel us to be silent, any 
more than they can hush the song of birds or the noise 
of beasts." 

Thunderingly they replied, with cries and exclama- 
tions: 

" Yes, yes! the forest is ours, we can speak here!" 

Then Etienne paused a moment, standing motionless 
upon the trunk of the tree. The moon, low in the 
horizon, shone only upon the high branches, and the 
spot where he stood was enveloped in darkness. He at 
the top of the hill stood out a black bar in the shadows. 

Slowly extending his arms he commenced; but his 
voice no longer trembled, he had taken the cold tone 
of a simple mandatory of the people giving his accounts. 
He began his speech where they had left off at the Bon- 
Joyeux, and he started a rapid history of the strike, 
speaking first of his repugnance against this fight: the 
miners had not wished it, the company had brought it 
on by their new tariff of propping. Then he recalled 
the first visit of the delegates to the director, the bad 
treatment by the company, and, later on, the second 
visit, its tardy concession, the two centimes returned 
which it had tried to steal from them. Next, the sav- 
ing fund was spoken of: with hasty calculations he 
showed how it, and also the aid sent from London, had 
been used up. In a few sentences he excused the 
International, Pluchart, vnà the others who, in trying 
to conquer the world, had forgotten them. The situation 
was becoming more and more desperate; the company 
threatened to discharge them and take some workmen 
from Belgium; besides, it had been intimated that there 
were some cowards among them, — men who had decided 
to go back to work. In a monotonous voice he spoke 
of their hunger, of the hope destroyed, while courage 
was fast disappearing in that terrible fight. And sud- 
denly he began his closing remarks without once raising 
his voice. 

" Under these circumstances, comrades, you should 
come to a decision this evening. Do you wish the con- 
tinuation of the strike? And in that case, what do you 
count on doing to triumph over the company?" 



224 GERMINAL. 

A profound silence fell from the starred sky. In the 
darkness, that crowd remained silent under these words 
which had come from his almost bursting heart, and 
beneath the trees nothing was heard save the painful 
breathing of the people. 

Then Etienne continued in a changed voice. It was 
no longer the secretary of the association who spoke; it 
was the chief of their band; the apostle bringing truth. 
Were they cowards to break their word? What! after 
suffering for a month would they return to the mine 
with heads bowed down, and allow that eternal misery 
to commence once more? Was it not better to die at 
once, trying to shake off that tyranny from which the 
workmen were starving? Was it not foolish to yield 
before that hunger which, in the first place, had thrown 
the calmest of them into a revolt? And he pointed 
out that the miners were alone compelled to suffer from 
the hard times, without food, although the strike had 
necessarily lowered the price of everything. No, the 
new tariff of wood was not acceptable; it was only a 
disguised economy; the company simply wished to steal 
from each man an hour of work per day. It was too 
much. The time had arrived when the miserable peo- 
ple pushed to an extremity would have justice. 

He remained standing with outstretched arms. At 
the word justice, the throng swayed slightly and then 
burst out into thundering applause, while voices cried : 

"Yes! It is time for justice." 

Little by little Etienne had warmed up. He did not 
have the easy flow of speech of Easseneur. He was 
often at a loss for words, his sentences coming out with 
an effort. Only he was so energetic and so much in 
earnest that he won his audience ; while with the ges- 
tures of an ordinary workman, his elbows were turned 
in ; then doubling up and throwing his fist forward, 
his jaw was extended and his words rang out. They all 
said he was not great, but he made them listen to him. 

"This paying wages is only a new form of labor," said 
he in a loud voice. " The mine should belong to the 
miners as the sea does to the fisherman, as the ground 
to the farmer. Do you hear ? The mine belongs to you 
who over a century ago paid for it with blood and 
misery." 



GERMINAL. 226 

Then he discussed some obscure questions of right, 
the special laws of the mine, in which he became lost. 
The ground below as well as above should belong to the 
nation; it was wrong for the state to give the monopoly 
to companies, as to Montson, for instance. But the 
mining people must conquer this estate; and with out- 
stretched hands he indicated the entire country beyond 
the forest. At that moment the rising moon, peeping 
through the high branches, lit up the spot on which 
he stood. When the crowd, still in darkness, perceived 
him standing thus as in a broad light, distributing 
fortune with his open hands, they again applauded. 

**Yes, yes, he's right, bravo!" 

At this point Etienne mounted his favorite hobby, 
the prerogative of instruments of labor by the collectivity, 
which he repeated in a phrase whose roughness grated 
pleasantly upon him. At home, the evolution was 
complete; leaving the softened fraternity of the 
catechumens, seeking to reform the pay department, 
he ended in the politic idea of suppressing it. Since 
the reunion at Bon-Joyeux, his collectivity, still human- 
itarian and without formula, had crystalized into a 
complicated programme, of which he scientifically dis- 
cussed each article. In the first place, he held that 
liberty could only be obtained by the destruction of the 
state. Then, when the people had the reins in their 
hands, reforms would commence. They would return 
to a primitive community; they would substitute fam- 
ily equality for family immorality, and instead of op- 
pression, absolute, civil, political, and economical 
equality ; they would gurantee individual independ- 
ence, thanks to the possession and the entire produc- 
tions of the instruments of labor ; and, finally, profes- 
sional education would be gratuitous — paid for out of 
the common fund. This involved an entire reconstruc- 
tion of the old rotten society ; he attacked marriage, 
and the right of making a will ; he regulated the fort- 
unes of each ; re-razed to the ground the iniquitous 
monuments of the dark ages, with a grand gesture of 
his arm always the same, the gesture of a mower who 
sweeps down the ripe harvest ; and then, with the other 
hand, he reconstructed, he built up the humanity of 
the future, the edifice of truth and justice rising in the 
15 



22G GERMINAL. 

dawn of the twentieth century. The excitement of 
his brain was so great that reason wavered, and there 
remained only the fixed idea of an extremist. The 
seriijiles of feeling and good sense vanislied ; nothing 
could be easier than the realization of this new world, 
he had provided for everything ; he spoke of it as of a 
machine which he could bring out in two hours, and 
neither fire nor blood were worth a thought. 

" Our turn has come," shouted he in a final outburst. 
** Power and wealth are coming to us at last." 

From the depths of the forest an acclamation reached 
him. The moon, now silvering all the glade, defined 
in sharp outlines the mass of heads, as far as the dim 
underwood afar off, between the gray trunks. And 
below were furious faces, sparkling eyes, open mouths, 
a crowd of people, men, women and children, fam- 
ished, and ready to regain by force the rights of which 
they had been dispossesed. Cold was felt no longer ; 
these burning words had warmed them through and 
through. A religious exaltation raised them above the 
earth ; the fever of hope known to the early Christians 
of the church, awaiting the coming reign of justice. 
Many obscure phrases had escaped them ; they under- 
stood but little of those technical and abstract reason- 
ings ; but even the obscurity, the aljstraction, enlarged 
the field of promises, dazzling the imagination. What 
a dream ! to be masters ! to cease to suffer ; at last to 
enjoy. 

" That^s right ; we're with you. Death to the people 
who leave us to starve ! " 

The women were especially excited. La Maheu 
lost her usual calmness ; sick from hunger, la Levaque 
screamed with all her might ; old Brule waved her 
witch-like arms, and Philomêne was overcome with a fit 
of coughing, while Moquette became so aroused that 
she cried tender words to the orator. Among the men, 
Maheu was frantic with rage at Pierron, who was 
trembling, and Levaque, who had cried out too soon, 
interrupting the speaker ; while Zacharie and Moquet, 
though ill at ease, laughed with astonishment that their 
comrade had been able to speak so long without a drink. 
But Jeanlin, on the woodpile, made the most noise. 



GEEMINAL. 237 

screaming at Bebert and Lydie, shaking the basket in 
which lay Pologne. 

The uproar could not be calmed. Etienne rejoiced 
at his popularity. It was as if he held his power there 
materialized in these three thousand breasts, whose 
hearts he could move with a single word. Near him, 
Jouvarine had applauded his own ideas as soon as he 
recognized them, contented with his comrade's progress 
toward anarchy ; sufficiently pleased with the pro- 
gramme, except the article on education ; the remains 
of sentimental folly, for holy and salutary ignorance, 
ought to be the bath for reinvigorating men. But Ras- 
seneur shrugged his shoulders with disdain and i-age. 

" Will you allow me to speak ? " said he to Etienne. 

The latter jumped from the tree trunk. 

"Speak ; we'll see if they'll listen to you." 

Rasseneur had already taken his place, and, with a 
gesture, called for silence. The noise did not dimin- 
ish. His name ran round among the foremost ranks, 
who had recognized him, as far aslihe last, lost under the 
beeches ; and they refused to hear him. He was an 
overthrown idol, and the sight of it alone was enough now 
to make his old worshipers angry. His easy style, his 
flowing words and his good humor, which had charmed 
so long, became at this hour only lukewarm, chiefly 
useful in putting cowards to sleep. In vain he spoke 
in the noise ; he wished to resume the soothing process, 
to sliow the impossibility of changing the world by 
blows of the law ; the necessity of leaving to social 
evolution time to work itself out. They made fun of 
him ; they mocked him ; his defeat at Bon-Joyeux was 
worse now, and becoming irremediable. They ended 
by throwing handfuls of frozen moss at him. A 
woman cried, shrilly. 

" Down with the traitor ! " 

He explained that the mine could not become the 
property of the miner ; they should prefer to partici- 
pate in the benefits ; the workman became then the 
child of the house. 

" Down with the traitor! " repeated a hundred voices, 
while stones commenced to fly. 

Then he grew pale, and despair filled his eyes with 
tears. This was the end of all, twenty years of ambi- 



228 GERMINAL. 

tious comradeship had given way under the ingratitude 
of the mass. He stepped from the stump with beating 
heart, unable to continue. 

"That makes you laugh," he stammered, addressing 
Etienne, who had triumphed. "Very well, I hope 
this will happen to you too." 

. And, as if casting off all responsibility in the unhap- 
piness which he foresaw, with a great gesture, he started 
off all alone across the silent and white country. 

As they were hooting after him, they were surprised 
to see Bonnemort standing upon the stump, trying to 
speak in the midst of the tumult. Up to that time he 
and Moque had been reflecting in that spot which 
brought the past up so vividly before them. Then he 
was taken with one of the sudden fits of loquacity which 
at times stirred up the past so violently as to cause him 
to talk for hours. 

A great silence fell, they listened to this old man, 
pale as a spectre, in the moonlight, and when he talked 
on of things not pertaining to the discussion, a ram- 
bling talk which they did not understand, the deep im- 
pression increased. Next he spoke of his youth, the 
death of two uncles crushed in the Voreux, then of the 
consumption; which carried ofif his wife. However, he 
did not abandon his first idea ; they had not made 
much progress, nor never should. They had met in 
this forest before: when the king did not wish to dimin- 
ish the hours of work. Then, though out of breath, he 
commenced the recital of other strikes, for he had 
seen many such. They had all met under these trees, 
either here at the Plan-des-Dames, there at the Char- 
bonnière, or still lower down at the Jaut-du-Loup. 
Sometimes they froze, while at other times it was warm, 
and once it had rained so hard they returned home 
without being able to say a word, while another night 
the king's soldiers had arrived and driven them back 
with their guns. 

"We've raised our hand like this; we've sworn not 
to go down again. . . . Yes! I swore, I swore." 

The people were becoming weary, when Etienne, who 
had been watching them, again leaped upon the stump, 
keeping the old man at his side. He had just recognized 
Cheval among the first row. The thought that Cath- 



GERMINAL. 239 

erine might be there filled him with new ardor and a 
wish to speak before her. 

" Comrades, you have heard ; here is one of our old 
men telling us what he has suffered, and what our 
children will also suffer, if we do not end these thefts 
and tortures." 

He was terrible ; never had he spoken so violently. 
With one arm he supported old Bonnemort, showing 
him as an example of misery and grief, crying ven- 
geance. In rapid sentences he went back to the first 
Maheus, pointing out that entire family, devoured by 
the company, in worse circumstances after having 
worked a hundred years. Then with them he com- 
pared the owners, who for a century had been nursed 
in luxury. Was it not frightful for men to starve at 
the bottom, from father to son, to pay for the minister's 
wine and the fêtes of the rich ladies and gentlemen ? 

He had been studying the diseases of miners ; they 
all died from some terrible disease, the scrofula, the 
black bronchitis, the asthma, which suffocated them, 
and the rheumatism, from which in the end they were 
paralyzed. These miserable people were worked like ma- 
chines, lodged like beasts, the great companies had sub- 
dued them little by little, threatening to form them all 
into regiments, millions of arms fighting for the fortune 
of a thousand idle ones. But the miner was no longer an 
ignorant brute crushed under the earth, an army push- 
ing on m the profoundness of the night. They were a 
crowd of citizens whose seed had taken root and would 
spring up and bring forth in a day of great promise. 
After forty years of service they had dared to offer an 
old man the pension of one hundred and forty francs, 
a man sixty years of age whose lungs were coated with 
coal dust and whose limbs were crippled from the water 
in the drifts. Yes, work would demand some account 
from the capital, from that omnipotent God, unknown 
to the workman, who was crouched somewhere in the 
recesses of his tabernacle, where he assisted in starving 
those who worshiped him. They would do well to see 
his face in the light of incendiary fires ; they would 
have the blood of that impure hog, that monstrous idol 
gorged with human flesh. 

He became silent, but his arms were still extended. 



230 GERMINAL. 

designating the home of their enemy somewhere in the 
distance. This time the noise of the crowd was so great 
that the wealthy people of Montson heard it, and went 
to listen at their windows, uneasy, filled with the fear 
of some terrible accident. Night birds were flying 
about under the pale light of the now dying moon. 
Then quieting the tumult, he concluded: 

'' Comrades, what is your decision? . . . Do you 
vote for a continuation of the strike?*' 

''Yes! yes!" screamed the many voices. 

"And what measures do you propose? Our defeat is 
sure if the comrades descend to-morrow." 

The voices resumed with a trumpet-like blast: 

"Death to the cowards." 

"You decide then to recall fchem to duty, to their 
sworn faith. . . . That is what you wish to do: we 
will present ourselves at the mines, bring back the 
traitors by our presence, show the company that we are 
all in accord, and that we will die sooner than yield." 

"That's it, to the mines! to the mines!" 

"While they were speaking, Etienne had been looking 
for Catherine among the heads before him. She was 
not there, decidedly. But he still saw Cheval, who was 
laughing and shrugging his shoulders, devoured with 
jealousy, ready to sell himself for a little of that pop- 
ularity. 

"And," continued Etienne, "if there are any spies 
among us, comrades, any men whom we mistrust, we 
know them. . . . Yes, I see the coal men of Van- 
dame, who have not left their mine." 

" Is that meant for me ?" demanded Cheval, with an 
air of bravado. 

" For you or any other. . . . But since you have 
spoken, you should know that those who have plenty to 
eat should have nothing to do with those who are hun- 
gry. You are working at Jean- Bart." 

A voice interrupted him : 

" Him work ! no, he has a wife who works for him." 

Cheval swore and his face reddened. 

"Good God ! is it forbidden to work, then?" 

" Yes ; when the comrades are enduring misery for 
the good of all, it is forbidden for any one to go over 
on the side of the owners. If the strike was general. 



GEEMIIfAL. 231 

we would have been masters long before this. . . . 
Is it right for a single man of Vandtime to go down, 
when all Montson has stood still ? The great blow 
would be struck if work was to stop from one side of the 
country to the other, at M. Deneulin's mines, as well 
as here. . . . Do you hear ? There are traitors in 
the drifts of Jean-Bart, You are all traitors." 

Around Cheval the crowd was growing threatening ; 
fists were raised, while cries broke forth : "To the 
death ! to the death ! " commenced to spring up. He 
had grown pale with fear. But in his anxiety to tri- 
umph over Etienne, an idea came to him, and he cried 
in a loud voice : 

*' Listen to me, now ! Come to Jean-Bart to-mor- 
row and you will see if I work. . . We are with 
you ; they have sent me to say so. Even the machinery 
will have to stop, for even the machinists are going to 
join the strike. It will be all the better if the pumps 
are stopped ; the water will burst into the mine, and 
ruin everything." 

He was furiously applauded, even Etienne became 
excited. Speakers followed each other, gesticulating 
in the noise, making wild propositions. It v/as a mo- 
ment of blind madness, the bloodthirsty impatience of 
a fanatical sect, which, weary of waiting for an ex- 
pected miracle, at last determined to face the event. 
Their senses distracted by hunger, pictured sanguinary 
visions, dreamt of fire and blood, from which rose uni- 
versal happiness, in an apotheosis of glory. The silvery 
moon bathed that multitude in peaceful light; the deep 
forest absorbed in its profound silence that cry of 
slaughter. Only the frozen moss crackled under their 
feet; while the trees, standing up in their strength with 
the delicate tracery of their branches dark against the 
white sky, neither perceived nor heard the miserable 
creatures who were exciting themselves at their feet. 

As they pushed each other in the crowd, la Maheu 
again found herself close to her husband, and both, 
losing their good sense, carried away by the exaspera- 
tion to which they had been slowly wrought up for 
months, applauded Levaque, who repeatedly demanded 
the heads of the engineers. Pierron had disappeared. 
Bonnemort and Moque, both speaking at the same time. 



232 GERMINAL. 

were uttering wild and violent thoughts which no 
one understood. In derision Zacharie demanded the 
destruction of the church, while Moquet, who had kept 
his mallet, beat the ground to increase the noise. The 
women were mad with excitement, la Levaque es- 
pecially, who, with her hands on her hips, was trying to 
quarrel with Philomene, whom she accused of laughing. 
Moquette was also excited, while old Brule screamed 
the loudest of any ; perceiving Lydie without her 
basket, she boxed her ears and continued to pour out 
curses upon the absent masters. 

Jeanlin was frightened for an instant, Bebert having 
learned from another boy that Madame Rasseneur had 
seen them steal Pologne, and that they were searching 
for them; but when Bebert desired to return and 
secretly lay the rabbit at the door of TAvantage, Jean- 
lin howled loudly and opened his new knife, brandish- 
ing the blade in a threatening manner. The wild 
clamor still continued, while the thin lips of Jouvarine, 
calm in the midst of the turmoil, parted in a smile. 

"Camrades! comrades!" shouted Etienne in a hoarse 
voice, trying to obtain a moment of silence, for the 
purpose of arriving at something definite. 

At length they listened to him. 

"Comrades! to-morrow morning at Jean-Bart, is it 
agreed ? " 

*'Yes, yes, at Jean-Bart. Death to the traitors." 

The thunder of three thousand voices filled the air 
and died away in the pure light of the moon. 



CHAPTER XXIV. 



At five o'clock it was very dark, the moon having 
gone down. Every one at Deneulin's was asleep; the 
old brick house was silent and dark, with doors and 
windows closed. A badly-kept garden separated it on 
one side from the mine Jean-Bart. On the other side 
ran the deserted town of Vandame, a great market- 
town, three kilometres behind the forest. 

Deneulin, completely tired out, having passed half 
of the day before at the bottom of the mine, was snor- 



GERMINAL. 233 

ing with his face turned toward the wall, when he 
dreamed some one was calling him. He awoke and, 
really hearing a voice, ran to open the window. It 
was one of his overseers, who stood in the garden under 
the window. 

"What's the matter?' he asked. 

** Monsieur, it's a strike; half of the workmen don't 
want to work, and have come to prevent the other 
half from going down." 

He scarcely understood, his head being still heavy 
from sleep, A cold wind came in through the window, 
almost freezing him. 

" Compel them to go down," he stammered. 

*'It has been going on for an hour," resumed the 
overseer. "Then we thought we had better come and 
look for you. Perhaps you can make them listen to 
reason." 

"All right, I will go." 

He dressed quickly. His mind had become clear 
now, and he was very uneasy. They might have ran- 
sacked the house, for neither the cook nor other servant 
had as yet stirred. But, from the other side of the hall 
came the sound of alarmed whispers, and when he went 
out he saw the door of his daughters' room open, while 
both girls stood on the threshold, dressed in white 
wrappers, hastily put on. 

"What is the matter, father?" 

Lucie, the elder, was twenty-two years of age, a tall 
brunette, with a superb carriage; while the younger, 
Jeanne, scarcely nineteen, was still prettier, being small, 
with golden hair and a winning grace. 

"Nothing of any consequence," he replied, to reas- 
sure them. "It appears that the strikers are making 
some little trouble at the mine. I am going to see 
about it." 

But they did not wish him to go out without first 
taking something warm. Otherwise, he would return 
home ill. He broke away from them, saying he was in 
a hurry. 

"Listen," said Jeanne, hanging on to his neck, 
" you are going to drink a little glass of whisky and 
eat a couple of crackers, or I shall remain like this and 
you will be forced to carry me off with you." 



234 GERMINAL. 

He was obliged to resign himself, though he swore 
that the biscuits would choke him. Then, candle in 
hand, both girls ran down stairs before him. In the 
dining-room they hastened to serve him, one pouring 
out the whisky while the other ran to the closet to find 
a paper of crackers. Having lost their mother very 
young, they had been badly brought up, spoiled by their 
father. The elder wished to become an operatic singer, 
while the younger was anxious to paint well. When 
they were compelled to cut down their expenses on 
account of the great embarrassment in business affairs, 
these girls, before so extravagant, became very careful 
housekeepers, who discovered the errors of centimes in 
the family accounts. Now, they kept the purse, and 
cut down these expenses, and quarreled with the dealers; 
but constantly repaired their toilets, and in other ways 
made the house more comfortable. 

" Eat, papa," said Lucie. 

Then, noticing the preoccupied air into which he had 
again fallen, silent, overwhelmed, she again became 
uneasy. 

" It must be serious, or you would not look as you do. 
Say, now, we will remain at home with you; they can 
do without us at that lunch." 

She spoke of a party which had been planned for that 
morning. Madame Hennebeau was first going to drive 
to Gregoire'sto get Cécile, then she would come and take 
them in the landau, and they were all going to Mar- 
chiennes to lunch at the Forges, where they had been 
invited, by the wife of one of the directors, for the pur- 
pose of visiting the workshops, the high furnaces and 
the coke fires. 

" Certainly, we shall remain at home," declared 
Jeanne. 

But he became angry. 

"What an idea! I tell you it is nothing. Do me 
the pleasure of going back to your beds, and then at 
nine o'clock dress yourselves and keep your engage- 
ment." 

Embracing them, he hastily went out, and they heard 
the sound of his feet upon the frozen earth in the 
garden. 

Jeanne silently put away the bottle of whisky, whilei 



GERMI]S"AL. 235 

Lucie locked up the crackers. This apartment had the 
deserted look of all the dining-rooms in which the table 
is not set. Both girls took advantage of this early 
morning visit to see if anything remained from the day 
before. A soiled napkin was out of place; the servant 
must be reprimanded. At length they returned to 
their room. 

As he cut across the shortest paths of the garden, 
Deneulin thought over his lost fortune, that million 
which he had realized from Montson, intending to 
increase it, and which to-day was in such great risks. 
It had been a continuation of bad luck; there were 
enormous and unforeseen repairs, ruinous explorations; 
and, then, the industrial crisis came on just at the 
time when the profits began to appear. If the strike 
broke out with him, it was all over; it would kill him 
at one blow. He pushed open a little door; the build- 
ings of the mine were distinguishable in the dark 
night by a deepening of the shadows, lighted by some 
lanterns. 

Jean-Bart had not the importance of the Voreux, but 
the refitting had made it an attractive mine, according 
to the report of the engineers. They had not con- 
tented themselves with enlarging the shaft fifty metres 
and sinking it seven hundred and eight metres deeper, 
but they had newly equipped it; there was a new engine, 
new cages, and all the improvements provided by the 
latest advances of science ; and there was a studied 
elegance even in the construction of the screening shed, 
which was of artistic shape; the tower was ornamented 
with a clock; the superintendent's room and the engine 
room were shaped like the nave of a church of the 
Renaissance, and the chimney rose above them with a 
mosaic spiral made of black and red bricks. The hoist- 
ing engine was placed upon the other shaft of the grant 
— at the old mine Gaston-Marie, reserved entirely for 
this purpose, Jean-Bart, besides that for the cage of 
extraction, had only two openings, one for the steam 
ventilator and another for the ladders. 

In the morning, at four o'clock, Cheval was the first 
to arrive. lie talked with his comrades, and convinced 
them that they must imitate the miners of Montson, 
and demand an increase of five centimes per car. Soon 



236 GEEMINAL. 

the four hundred workmen went from the waiting-room 
to the superintendent's office, amid a tumult of gestures 
and outcries. Those who wished to descend, took their 
lamps, bared their feet, and put their tools under their 
arms; while the others, still with their shoes on and 
their coats upon their shoulders, owing to the terrible 
cold, barred the shaft; and the overseers made them- 
selves hoarse trying to preserve order, begging them to 
he reasonable and not to prevent those who wished, 
from going to work. 

Cheval was furious when he saw Catherine in panta 
and vest, her head covered with a blue scarf, ready to 
descend. That morning he had brutally told her not to 
leave their room at Montsou. She, in despair at the 
stoppage of work, had followed him, all the same, for 
he never gave her any money, and she was often forced 
to pay the expenses of both. What would become of 
her if she did not earn anything? She was filled with 
fear, the horror of a house of shame at Marchiennes 
where so many of the mine women, without bread and 
without home, ended. 

*' What in the name of God are you doing here," 
said Cheval. 

She stammered that she had not the rent and wished 
to work. 

''Then you put yourself against me, fool! . . . 
Go back right off or I'll give you a kick." 

In fear, she shrank back, but did not return, being 
resolved to see how matters would turn. 

Deneulin arrived by the stairway of the screening 
shed. In spite of the feeble light of the lanterns, with 
a quick glance, he took in the scene, that crowd among 
the shadows, each face of which he recognized, the 
diggers, the loaders, the wheelers, the pushers even to 
the small boys. In the nave, new and still clean, work 
paused in suspense; the engine under pressure, gave 
out slight puffs; the cages remained suspended by the 
motionless cables; the cars, abandoned on the way, en- 
cumbered the flagging. Scarcely twenty-five lamps had 
been taken from their places; the others were still burn- 
ing in the lamp-room. Without doubt a word from 
him would suffice and work would be resumed again. 

''Well! what is going on here, my children?" he 



GERMINAL. Sa? 

asked, in a loud voice. " What are you angry about? 
Explain it to me; we must understand each other.*' 

TJsually he was paternal toward his men, even though 
exacting heavy work. Authoritative and brusque by 
nature, he tried at first to control them by a good nat- 
ure, wliich had the showiness of a clarion; he often 
made himself loved, and the workmen especially re- 
spected him as a man of courage, always with them in 
the drifts, and the first in danger whenever an accident 
occurred at the mine. Twice, after explosions of fire 
damp, they had lowered him by a rope fastened under 
his arms, when the bravest among them had refused. 

" You see," said he, " you will make me repent that 
I placed confidence in you. You know that I have re- 
fused a guard of gendarmes. Speak calmly and I will 
listen.*' 

All were silent now, abashed, and yielding to him; 
but Cheval at length said: 

"It's this. Monsieur Deneulin: We can't keep on 
working like this; we want five centimes more a car." 

He appeared surprised. 

"What! five centimes! What is your reason for this 
demand? I do not complain of your propping. I have 
not imposed a new tariff on you, like the company at 
Montson." 

"That's so, but the comrades of Montson are right, 
all the same. They won't have the tariff, and they 
want five centimes because they can't work right with 
this poor pay. . . . We want five centimes, too, 
don't we, you others?" 

A number of voices approved; the clamor began 
again with violent gestures. Little by little they had 
all gathered round in a circle. 

Deneulin's eyes flashed, but he clenched his fist for 
fear of yielding to a temptation to choke them one after 
the other. He preferred to discuss the matter, to talk 
reasonably. 

" You wish five centimes, and I admit the work is 
worth it. But I cannot give them to you. If I make 
this advance I shall simply be ruined. . . . You 
should understand that I must make a living in order 
that you may live. And I am at the limit; the least 
increase in price of labor would throw me head over 



238 GERMINAL. 

heels. . . . Eemember, two years ago at the last 
strike I yielded, I was not able then. But that raise of 
salary has almost ruined me, though I have struggled 
along for two years. . . . To-day I would rather 
leave the business at once, than not to know where to 
get the money to pay you next month." 

Cheval laughed disagreeably in the face of this master 
who so frankly told them of his affairs. The others, 
were obstinate and incredulous, unable to compre- 
hend that a chief did not earn millions from his work- 
men. 

Then, Deneulin was forced to insist. He explained 
his strife against the Montson company who were always 
on the watch, ready to devour him if the slightest 
chance occurred. Just at present he was forced to 
economize, the increased depth of Jean-Bart had made 
the expense of hoisting still greater, the unfavorable 
conditions of affairs scarcely compensated for the thick 
bed of coal found. He would not have raised the salary 
of the miners at the last strike had he not been obliged 
to imitate Montson for fear of seeing his men leave 
him; but if they had have done so although they would 
have succeeded in compelling him to give up his mine, 
they would also have made their own condition more 
deplorable by joining the Montson company. He was 
not enthroned in some tabernacle afar off; he was not 
one of those men who paid managers to strip the miners, 
and who was never seen by them; he was a master who 
risked other things than his money, he risked his intel- 
ligence, his health, his entire life. A stoppage of work 
would simply be his death. He had no stock on hand, 
and moreover it was necessary for him to execute his 
orders. On the other side the capital could not sleep 
without causing disaster. How could he keep his en- 
gagements? how could he pay the interest on the sums 
intrusted to him by his friends? He would be sure to 
fail. 

"And it is just this, my good men! " said he in con- 
clusion. "I wish to convince you. . . . You do 
not ask a man to ruin himself, do you? If I should give 
you the five centimes, or you should join the strike, it 
would be cutting my throat." 

As he became silent, growls were heard. But a part 



GEEMINAL. 23Ô 

of the miners seemed to hesitate. Several started to- 
ward the shaft as if resolved to descend. 

"At least/' said an overseer, "let every one be free. 
Who are those who wish to work?" 

Catherine was one of the first to advance. But Cheval, 
furious, pushed her back, crying: 

" We're all together; it's only cowards who leave their 
comrades." 

A reconciliation appeared impossible. The cries had 
again commenced while at a risk of mashing the willing 
ones against the wall the strikers pushed them away 
from the shaft. For an instant the director, desperate, 
tried to drive them back, but it was useless, and he was 
obliged to give up. Out of breath he seated himself on 
a chair in the superintendent's room, so aware of being 
powerless that not an idea of what to do came to liini. 
At length he became calm; he sent an overseer to find 
Cheval; then when the latter had consented to an inter- 
view he sent every one away with a gesture. 

" Leave us alone." 

Deneulin's idea was to see what the fellow had in 
him. He at once found him to be vain, and devoured 
with jealousy. Then he commenced to flatter him, 
affecting to be astonished that a workman of his merit 
should compromise his prospects in such a manner. 
For a long time he had had his eyes on him for a rapid 
promotion, and lie ended by squarely offering to make 
him overseer later on. Cheval listened, at first silent 
with hands clenched, then little by little he quieted 
down. Meanwhile he began thinking; if he remained 
in the strike he could never hope to be more than a 
lieutenant under Etienne, while now another step was 
open to him, that of being one of the chiefs. A flush 
of pride mounted to his face, he became intoxicated. 
Then again, the band from Montson which he had been 
expecting since early morning, would certainly not 
come now, some obstacle must have kept them back, 
gendarmes perhaps; it was time to yield. But he no 
more refused, with a shake of the head, he played 
the role of an uncorrupted man, laying his hand on his 
heart. Finally without speaking to the director about 
the meeting he had given to the Montson men at this 



â40 GERMINAL. 

mine, he promised to calm his comrades and influence 
them to descend. 

Deneulin remained concealed, even tlie overseers held 
aloof from that fight. For an hour they heard Cheval 
haranguing, discussing, as he stood upon a car before 
the superintendent's office. A party of workmen 
shouted at him, a hundred and twenty went off in- 
dignant, obstinate in their resolution which he had 
compelled them m the first place to take. It was 
already more than seven o'clock. Daylight had long 
since broken on a bright, clear day, cold and frosty. 
And all at once the noise of the mme began again, the 
work continued. The machinery was first set in motion, 
while the cables began to wind and unwind. Then, as 
the signals were shouted, the descent began, the cages 
filled up, sank down and arose again; the shaft swallowed 
its daily allowance of boys, girls and men, while on the 
iron flagging the wheelers pushed their cars, making a 
thundering noise. 

"Great God! what are you doing now?", said Cheval 
to Catherine, who was waiting her turn. '' Why don't you 
go on down?" 

At nine o'clock, when Mme. Hennebeau and Cécile 
arrived in the landau, they found Lucie and Jeanne, 
beautifully dressed, awaiting them. But Deneulin was 
astonished on perceiving Mégrel, who had accompanied 
the carriage on horseback. But Mme. Hennebeau ex- 
plained, in a natural manner, that she was afraid, the 
roads were so full of hard-looking people, and that she 
had preferred to bring a protector. Megrel laughed, 
reassuring them; nothing was serious — it all, as usual, 
ended in threats; not one of them would dare to throw 
a stone into a pane of glass. Joyful at his success, 
Deneulin told them of the subdued rebellion at Jean- 
Bart. Now everything was quiet, and upon the road 
to Vandame, after the young ladies had gotten into the 
c irriage, they all became very cheerful in that bright 
weather, without guessing that, at a short distance off 
in the country, a long murmur was spreading out, while, 
if they had pressed their ears to the ground, they could 
have heard the tramp, tramp of the people. 

"Well! it is understood," said Mme. Hennebeau; 
" this evening you will come and dine with us and take 



GEKMINAL. 241 

the girls home. Madame Grégoire has also promised to 
come for Cécile/' 

" Yes, you can expect me," answered Deneulin. 

The landau started off toward Vandame and Jeanne 
and Lucie looked back to smile at their father who re- 
mained standing in the road; while Megrel rode gal- 
lantly behind them. 

They crossed the forest and took the road between 
Vandame and March iennes. As tliey approached Tar- 
taret, Jeanne asked Mme. Hennebeau if she knew the 
Côte- Verte road; and when the latter, in spite of her 
five years' residence in this country, acknowledged that 
she had never gone that way, they turned into the road. 
Tartaret, on the edge of the woods, was an uncultivated 
piece of laud of volcanic barrenness, under which, for 
some centuries, had been burning an old coal mine. 
The miners of that country told its history. The fire 
from heaven had fallen on that spot for the evil doings 
of the boys and girls of the mine, and it had come down 
so quickly that they had no chance to ascend, and that 
to-day they are still below burning in that hell. The 
rocks' of a dark red well covered with an efïïoresence of 
alum. Sulphur seemed to grow from a yellow flower 
which sprang up on the edge of the fissures. At night 
the bravest ones, who had dared risk an eye to one of 
those holes, swore that they saw flames and the wicked 
ones' souls just shriveling up in the still buried coal. 
Stray lights rose from the ground; hot steam con- 
tinually poured out. And thus, as a miracLe of eternal 
spring, in the midst of that miserable land of Tartaret, 
the Côte- Verte was always covered with green turf, its 
trees of which the leaves were constantly renewed, 
while its fields had as many as three harvests a year. 
It was a natural hot-house, warmed by the heat from 
the burning coal. The snow never remained there. 
The enormous growth of verdure and the trees spread 
out without having even been reddened by the frost. 

Soon the carriage rolled into the open country, 
Megrel jokingly told the legend; then explained how 
the fire began at the bottom of that mine by the fer- 
mentation of the coal dust, and when they could not 
get control of it it burned on and on forever. He told 
of a mine in Belgium which they had flooded without 
16 



243 GERMIXAL. 

putting out the fire. But he became silent, every 
moment bands of miners passed the carriage. Though 
tliey walked by in silence, angry looks were cast on that 
luxury which forced them to stand aside. The crowd 
became more numerous as the horses crossed the little 
bridge of the Scarpe. What was the matter that these 
people were all on the road thus? The women began 
to be frightened; Megrel began to suspect something 
was going on in that quivering country; and it was a 
relief when they at last arrived at Marchiennes. Under 
the sun, which seemed to extinguish them, the rows of 
coke fires and the furnaces threw out their smoke, 
from which the eternal soot filled the air. 



CHAPTER XXV. 



At Jean-Bart, Catherine for an hour had been push- 
ing her car; and she was so covered with perspiration 
that she stopped for a moment to wipe her face. 

"From the end of the drift, where he was at work with 
some other comrades. Cheval was astonished that he no 
longer heard the sound of the wheels. The lamps were 
burning badly, the coal dust i^revented him from see- 
ing. 

*' What's this?" cried he. When she answered him 
that she was surely going to melt, and that her heart 
was feeling queer; he answered her in anger: 

"Fool, do as we do, take off your shirt." 

They were seven hundred and eight metres at the 
north, in the first road of the vein Desiree, which was 
three, kilometres from the shaft-room. WHien they 
spoke of that part of the mine the miners of tlie coun- 
try paled and lowered their voices as though tliey were 
speaking of hell; and they contented themselves more 
often with shaking of their heads, not wishing to talk 
of that hot region. As the galleries went toward the 
north they aj^proached Tartaret, tliey penetrated into 
the interior fire, which coated the rocks above. The 
drifts in which they were now working had arrived at a 
temperature of forty degrees. They found themselves 
in a horrible underground place, in the midst of the 



GERMIN-AL. 243 

flames which the people overhead saw through the fis- 
sures, and which emitted sulphur and abominable 
vapors. 

Catherine, who was already without her blouse, hesi- 
tated, and then took off her pants, and with bare arms 
and legs, her chemise tied around the waist with a 
string, she again began to push. 

" That's better," said she, in a loud voice. 

Mingled with her sufferings from the heat, a great 
fear filled her. In the six days she had worked there, 
slie constantly thought of the stories which had been 
told her in childhood of those boys and girls in olden 
times who had been so terribly punislied for their mis- 
behavior. Of course she was too old now to believe 
such nonsense; but she could not lielp thinking what 
she would do if she was to see a red-liot girl come out 
of the wall, and that idea made her perspire still more. 

Sixty metres from tlie drift another pusher took the 
car and rolled it sixty metres farther on, as far as the 
foot of the inclined plane, up which the receiver sent it. 

" Heavens ! you're making yourself comfortable, '^ 
said that woman, a slight widow of thirty years, when 
she saw Catherine in the road. 

*' I don't care," replied the girl, " I suffer too much." 

She went off, pushing an empty car. The worst of 
it was, in that bottom road, another cause joined Tar- 
taret to render the heat un supportable. At the old 
works was a gallery, Gaston-Marie, very deep, in which 
ten years before an explosion of fire-damp had set fire 
to the vein, which still burned behind a clay wall that 
had immediately been built there and was always kept 
in repair to limit the disaster. Deprived of air the fire 
ought to have gone out; but a draft from somewhere 
or other still kept it alive. It had been burning for 
ten years, heating up the wall like the bricks of an 
oven until they could have cooked upon them. And 
along that wall of more than a hundred feet the car 
road was made in a temperature of sixty degrees. 

After two trips, Catherine again became suffocated. 
Happily the road was large and commodious, that vein, 
Desiiee, being one of the thickest in the mine. The 
bed was seventy metres thick and the men could work 



244 GERMINAL. 

standing. But they would have preferred to work with 
their necks twisted and to have a little fresh air. 

*' Are you asleep down there/' screamed Cheval, when 
he no longer heard Catherine moving. "Go on; no, fill 
your cart and roll." 

She was at the bottom of the drift, leaning on her 
shovel; and almost overcome, she looked at him with 
an imbecile air without obeying. She saw badly in the 
flickering rays of the lamp. But they could see her for 
the picks ceased, and they laughed at her for taking off 
her blouse. 

"Take care, you'll catch cold." 

Catherine again began filling her car, then pushed it 
off. The road was too large for her to knock herself 
against the sides. Her bare feet were twisted between 
the rails seeking a support; while she slowly went for- 
ward with the muscles of her arms stiff, her back bent. 
And when she went along the wall her agony was in- 
creased, the prespiration fell from her whole body in 
enormous drops, like the rain from a thunder storm, 
and she arrived at the end of her journey blinded and 
also covered with a black mud. 

What was the matter with her that day? She had 
never felt such a giving way in her bones. There must 
be some bad air. That out of the way road was badly 
aired at any rate. They breathed all sorts of gas which 
came out of the coal with a little sound like the bubbling 
of a spring, so abundant sometimes that the lamps re- 
fused to burn; then there was the fire-damp about 
Avhich they no longer troubled themselves, the whole 
vein smelt of it from one day's end to another. She 
knew it Avell, that bad air, that air of death as the 
miners called it. Since her childhood she had inhaled 
so much of it that she was astonished not to be iible to 
stand it better that day, for her ears were ringing and 
her head was as though on fire. Surely, it was the heat 
that was making her sick. 

Then she concluded to remove her chemise, for even 
it was a torture, as the least wrinkle in it cut and 
burned her, but she started to push again without 
doing so. After a few minutes she said to herself that 
she would put it on before she came to the end of her 
journey, so she untied the string and let the last article 



GERMIXAL. 245 

of clothing drop; she was in sucli figony that she would 
have torn her very skin off if she had been able. Then 
entirely nude, she went on with her terrible labor. 

But she began to despair, it had not eased her one 
bit. What could she take off now? The buzzing in 
her ears made her giddy; she seemed to be pressed as in 
a vice. She fell upon her knees. Her lamp wedged in 
on the coal in the car seemed to be going out. Amid 
her confused ideas the thought came to her to turn up 
the wick. Twice she started to examine it and both 
times just as she got before it she saw it become dimmer 
as if she were blowing it. Suddenly it went out en- 
tirely. Then in the shadows everything commenced to 
go round, her heart almost stopped beating, and over- 
come with the great fatigue she fell over on the ground, 
flat upon her back, to die in that air of aspliyxy. 

"I believe she's still laying around,^' growled Cheval. 

He listened at the top of the drift, and, not hearing 
the sound of wheels, called "Catherine." 

His voice was lost in the distance of that black gallery, 
and not a breath responded. 

"Do you want me to come and make you move?" 

Nothing stirred. There still reigned the same death- 
like silence. Furious, he descended, running so f;ist 
that he fell upon the body of the girl, who barred the 
way. 

He looked at her in amazement. What was the mat- 
ter with her? It was a shame to pretend to be sick just 
to get a nap. But, as he lowered the lamp to look in her 
face, it threatened to go out. He turned it up, and it 
went down again; then he understood, it must be bad 
air. The anger was all gone, the miner's devotion 
awoke before that comrade who was in peril. He seized 
her in his arms just as she was, raising her up as high 
as possible in the fresher air, and, when the men had 
thrown over his arm the clothing of both, he set out on 
foot, running, sustaining his unconscious burden with 
one hand and carrying his lamp with the other. The 
deep gallery wound down; he ran on, first to the right, 
then to the left, going to seek for life in the freezing air 
from the plain which blew from the ventilator. At 
length the sound of running water made him pause, and 
he found himself at the cross-road of a now abandoned 



346 GERMINAL. 

rolling gallery, which was formerly used for the Gaston- 
Marie. There it blew like a tempest, and it was so cold 
that he shivered as he seated himself on the ground 
with the girl in his arms, who was still unconscious, her 
eyes closed. 

" Catherine, look up; good God! don't fool. Take 
care, or I'll put you in the water." 

He was afraid, to see her so still. But he wet a cor- 
ner of her cliemise in the water and bathed her face in 
it. She looked as if she was dead, buried already at 
the bottom of the earth. Suddenly she opened her 
eyes, stammering: 

"I'm cold." 

"Ah! that is better," said Cheval, relieved. 

And he began dressing her, swearing at the trouble 
which he had in putting' on her blouse, for she was not 
able to assist him a great deal. She was amazed, not 
comprehending where she was or why she was naked. 
Then, when she remembered, she was ashamed. How 
had she gotten there!'' and she questioned him. Had 
any one seen her that vv^ay. He, to tease her, told some 
stories how he had brought her there in the midst of all 
their comrades. Then, when she almost cried with 
shame, he gave her his word that he had run so quickly 
no one was able to see her. 

" I'm dying of the cold," said she, hastening on her 
clothes. 

She had never known him to be so good to her; for 
one kind word he said to her, she received two harsh 
ones. A tenderness penetrated her in her fatigue; she 
smiled on him, and murmured: 

" Put your arms around me." 

He did as she asked, then stretched himself out be- 
side her while waiting for her to be able to walk. 

" You see," continued she, "you were wrong to yell 
at me so for I couldn't keep on. It's not as hot in the 
drift, but if you only knew, why it's like an oven in that 
road." 

"Yes," replied Cheval, "of course we'd be better 
off under the trees. I knew it was hard on you there, 
my poor girl." 

It touched her to hear him speak so kindly. 

" Oh! it's a bad place. We'll end up there sometime 



GERMINAL. 247 

or other. And then to-day the air is bad. . . . 
But I -won't be any trouble to you. When a person has 
to work they must do it, mustn't they? Why, I'd die 
sooner than give in." 

He was silent. With his arm thrown around her he 
held her to his breast to prevent her from taking cold. 
Although she already felt the strength to return, in her 
delight at his tenderness she forgot everything else. 

" Only," murmured she in a low voice, "I do want 
you to be kinder to me. A girl is so content when her 
lover has some little love for her." 

And she began to cry softly. 

" But I do love you," cried he. " Haven't I taken up 
with you?" 

She only replied with a sorrowful shake of the head. 
Men often took up with women whose love they laughed 
at. Her tears fell thick and fast. It made her des- 
perate to think of the happy life she might have lead 
if she had fallen upon another man, whose arm would 
have been always passed thus around her waist, and 
whose kisses would have been given unasked. And 
in her great emotion the image of another came up be- 
fore her. But that was ended. She wished to live with 
this one until the end, only if he would not treat her so 
badly. 

*' Why can't you be like this always? " said she. 

And as she still cried he embraced her again. 

*' You're crazy! Yes, I swear to be good to you. 
One man is no worse than another." 

She looked at him and smiled. Perhaps he was 
right; happy women were seldom heard cf. Then she 
gave herself up to the joy of seeing him amiable. If it 
could only have lasted! Suddenly steps were heard. 
Three comrades who had seen them pass were coming 
to inquire what was the matter. 

They went off together. It was almost ten o'clock, 
and the men had commenced to eat their lunch. When 
they had finished the sandwich and were about to drink 
their coffee, a rumbling noise was heard coming from 
the distance. They grew uneasy. What now ? was 
this another accident ? They all ran off, miners passed 
them every second, and none knew what was the matter. 
They were all crying that it must be something terrible. 



248 GERMINAL. 

Little by little the entire mine had become upset, 
shadows filled the gallery, the lantern danced in the 
darkness. Where was it ? Why did no one tell them ? 

Suddenly, an overseer passed them, crying : 

" The cables are cut, the cables are cut." 

Then the panic increased. They ran rapidly across 
the dark roads, almost out of their minds. 

Why had they cut the cables ? and who had cut them 
when the men were at the bottom ? That was monstrous. 
But the voice of another overseer broke out, then be- 
came lost. The Montson people cut the cables. 

When Cheval comprehended he stopped Catherine. 
The thought that he would meet the Montson miners if 
he went out, frightened him. . So they had come, that 
band whom he believed in the hands of the gendarm.es ! 
For an instant he thought of retracing his steps and 
going up by the Gaston-Marie, but as they no longer 
worked there, he would have needed some ropes. He 
swore, filled with fear, as he said that it was foolish to 
run like that. Perhaps they were not going to leave 
them at the bottom. 

The voice of the overseer was again heard coming 
nearer. 

" To the ladders! to the ladders! " 

And Cheval, in spite of his rage, was carried on with 
his comrades. Then the panic seized him, he shoved 
Catherine, accusing her of not running fast enough. 
Did she want them to stay in the mine alone, to die of 
hunger? for those robbers of Montson were capable of 
breaking the ladders, without waiting for the people to 
come out. That abominable supposition drove them all 
distracted. In the galleries were only a stream of 
fools, all trying to go up first. Cries broke out that 
the ladders were broken, that no one could go out. 
And when they commenced to pass by frightened 
groups into the shaft room, they threw themselves to- 
ward the shaft and broke in the door to the ladders; 
while an old stableman who had Just prudently put the 
horses back in the stable, watched these men with an 
air of unconscious disdain, accustomed to the nights 
passed in the mine, certain that some one would draw 
him out of it. 

*' Great heavens! Can't you get in front of me?'* 



GEKMIXAL. 249 

cried Cheval to Catherine; '' I can hold 3'ou, then, if 
you fall." 

Suffocated by that run of three kilometres which had 
once more covered her with perspiration, she gave up 
and allowed herself to be elbowed about by the crowd. 
Then he pulled her along by the arms, nearly bi-eaking 
them; and her tears broke forth again; he had already 
forgotten their talk, she could never be happy. 

" Go on! " screamed he. 

But he frightened her too much. She resisted him 
and the throng of frightened people pushed them on 
one side. The water running down from the shaft fell 
in great drops and the floor of the shaft room shook 
under the stamping, trembling above tlie v/ater-sump 
ten metres deep where all the water collected. Two 
years before at Jean-Bart a terrible accident had oc- 
cured; a cable broke and threw the cage to the bottom 
of the sump, and tv&gt;'o men who were in one of the cars 
were drowned. And everyone thought of it, on going 
there when a great number stood upon the boards which 
planked it over. 

"Mercy on me!" cried Cheval; *'die then, I'll be 
free." 

He went on and she followed him. 

From the- bottom to the top there were a hundred and 
two ladders, nearly seven meters in length, each placed 
upon a straight landing ; the small opening which led to 
them only just permitted the passage of the shoulders. 
It was like a chimney seven hundred high steps between 
the side of the shaft and the partition of the hoisting 
compartment, a long, damp and narrow gut, black and 
seemingly without end where the ladders were placed 
almost straight and by regular stories. It took twenty- 
five minutes for a strong man to go up that giant 
column. However, the ladders were only used in case 
of a catastrophe. 

At first, Catherine went up easily. Her naked feet 
had grown accustomed to climbing and did not yet 
suffer from the rungs which were covered with iron to 
prevent wear. Her hands, hardened by rolling, clung 
without fatigue to the mountings too great for them. 
And even that occupied her, almost putting an end to 
her chagrin, that unforseen ascent, that long, serpentine 



250 GERMINAL. 

line of men, slowly pulling themselves up, three on a 
ladder, and the leader would arrive at the top when the 
last man was about to start from the bottom. But they 
were not there yet for the first of them were only a third 
from the top. No one spoke, the feet went on and on 
with a dull sound ; while the lamps equal to moving 
stars, sparkled from above to below in an always enlarg- 
ing line. 

Behind her, Catherine heard a boy counting the lad- 
ders. She also started to do so. They had already 
gone up fifteen and had arrived at a level. But at that 
instant she hit against the legs of Cheval. He swore, 
telling her to be more careful. At times the whole 
column paused, motionless. What was the matter? 
what had happened? And each one questioned in 
terror. The agony increased as they left the bottom 
fearing what was above. Some one cried that it was 
necessary to go down again, that the ladders were 
broken. That was the thought of all, the fear of find- 
ing themselves before emptiness. Another terrible 
story descended from mouth to mouth, the accident of 
a man slipping from a ladder. They did not know 
precisely what cries prevented them from hearing. Were 
they going to remain there? At last without any warn- 
ing the ascent was resumed with the same slow and 
painful movement, amid the shaking from the feet and 
the dancing lamps. Surely, higher on, the ladders 
would be broken. 

At the thirty-second ladder, when they had passed a 
third level, Catherine felt her limbs becoming stiff. At 
first she felt the skin slightly tingle, then she lost all 
feeling in her feet and hands. A great weakness came 
upon her little by little, attacking the muscles. And in 
the giddiness which came upon her she remembered a tale 
of her grandfather^s that in his early days the boys of 
ten years used to go up these ladders with the coal 
upon their shoulders, and they were so open and badly 
built that when one of the boys slipped, or a piece of 
coal fell from a basket, three or four of the children 
would tumble down at one time. But to-day one could 
not fall but a few metres. That tale frightened her, 
becoming a veritable nightmare, for the cramps in her 



GERMIXAL. 251 

limbs became insupportable, and she said to herself that 
she could never go to the end. 

Three pauses gave them all an opportunity to draw 
a breath. But the terror which they felt at each new 
arrest overwhelmed them. Above and below one could 
hear the heavy breathing. It confused the girl, who 
now began to feel nausea, adding itself to her other 
horrible feelings. She was suffocating, dizzy in the 
half darkness, angry at the scraping of her flesh on the 
sides; and she also suffered from the dampness, her 
body was in a shivering perspiration from the great 
drops which soaked her. They were approaching a 
level. The rain beat so strong that it threatened to ex- 
tinguish the lamps. 

Twice Cheval had questioned Catherine without 
obtaining any answer. What was she doing down 
there? Had she fallen? She might, at least, tell him 
she was holding on. They had been going up for a 
half hour, but so slowly and with so many pauses that 
they were only at the fifty-ninth ladder. Still forty- 
three. At last Catherine told him she was still there. 
He would have abused her if she had spoken of her 
weariness. The iron of the rungs was now cutting her 
feet. They seemed to have sawed into her as far as the 
bone. After each pull she expected to see her hands 
leave the rungs above her, skinned and so stiff that the 
fingers would not shut; and she felt as if she would fall 
backwards; her shoulders scratched, her thighs strained 
from her continual efforts. It was especially a fear of 
those steep ladders which increased her sickness, those 
which were placed almost straight and compelled her to 
pull herself up by the strength of her thumbs. The 
furious breathing of the people drowned all other sound, 
a sort of rustling noise which came up from the bottom 
and expired at the top. Whispers ran from one to 
the other, a boy had just torn open the top of his head 
against a landing. 

Catherine still went on. They passed a level. The 
lain had ceased, the heat increased, weighing down 
their chests in thick case-like air, poisoned with an odor 
of old iron and damp wood. Mechanically she still kept 
on counting, sixty-one, sixty-two, sixty-three, still nine- 
teen, she could never arrive. These figures repeated 



252 GERMINAL. 

over and over, sustained her with their rythmical 
bahmce, for she was no longer conscious of her move- 
ments, she bent her limbs to the acquired strength in a 
state of sad somnambulism. Around her the lamps 
seemed to dance. She thought she was dying, the least 
breath would have knocked her over. The worst was 
that those from below were pushing now, the entire 
column was rushing on yielding to the rage of fatigue 
and a furious wish to again see the sun. Some com- 
rades, those aliead, had gone out; there was therefore 
no broken ladders; but the thought that they could yet 
break them, to 2)revent the last from getting out when 
the others were already breathing above, ended by 
setting them wild. And when a stop was made again, 
oaths burst forth, and they went on; pushing each 
other, v.'ishing to pass over the bodies of those who 
were almost there. 

Then Catherine slipped. She cried to Cheval in a 
despairing appeal. But he did not hear; he had beaten 
his way higher up by pushing aside some comrades. 
And she fell and was trampled upon. In her fright, 
it seemed to her that she was one of those little boys in 
olden times, and that a piece of coal falling from a 
basket above her head had thrown her down the shaft, 
like a stone. Only five ladders remained to climb; they 
had taken nearly an hour for the ascent. She never 
knew how she arrived, though she was carried on some 
one's shoulders. Suddenly she found herself in the 
dazzling sunlight, in the midst of a hov/ling mob who 
hooted at her. 



CHAPTER XXVI. 



From early morning, confused murmuring was heard 
in the alleys, that sound which swelled out through the 
roads and the entire countr}^ But the intended depart- 
ure had not taken place. News burst upon them; the 
gendarmes were upon the plain. Some one told how 
they had arrived from Douai during the night, and they 
accused Easseneur of having betrayed his comrades by 
warning M. Hennebeau; and a woman even swore that 



GERMINAL. 353 

she had seen the servant pass who carried the message 
to the telegraph station. The miners doubled up their 
fists, and watched the gendarmes from behind their 
shutters in the pale light of the young day. 

Towards half past seven, when the sun had risen, an- 
other report was circulated, reassuring the impatient 
ones. It was simply a military parade, such as they 
were compelled to make at the time of a strike, upon 
the order of the Prefect of Lille. The strikers held in 
execration that officer, whom they accused of having 
deceived them by the promise of a conciliatory inter- 
view; but who had limited himself to send his troops to 
Montson only for eight days. Thus, when they saw the 
gendarmes quietly go away, on the road to Marchiennes, 
after having contented themselves with deafening the 
alleys with the trot of their horses upon the frozen 
earth, they laughed at the prefect and his gendarmes, 
who started off just as things were about to warm up. 

Up to nine o'clock they behaved very well, peacefully 
keeping indoors, while their eyes followed the backs of 
the last gendarmes. The wealthy people of Montson, 
with heads pressed on their pillows, were still asleep. 
At the director's, they saw Madame Hennebeau set 
forth in her carriage, while M. Hennebeau was no 
doubt at the works, for the house seemed silent. No 
mine was militarily guarded, it was the fatal improvi- 
dence for the hour of danger, the natural stupidity 
about catastrophies, and it would be impossible for a 
government not to commit errors when they have not 
yet learned the facts. But nine o'clock had scarcely 
struck, when the coal men had started off on the Van- 
dame road to show themselves at the meeting place 
which had been decided on the evening before in the 
forest. 

However Etienne comprehended at once that he 
should not have at Jean-Bart the three thousand com- 
rades upon which he had counted. Many believed the 
manifestation postponed, and it was too late to send 
another command through the alleys for those who 
were already on the road might compromise the cause 
if he was not at their head. Almost a hundred who 
had started out before daylight must be hidden under 
the bushes in the forest waiting for the others. Jouvar- 



254 GERMINAL. 

ine, whom Etienne went to consult, shrugged his shoul- 
ders; ten resolved men would do more work tlmn a 
mob; and he went back to the open book before him, 
refusing to be one of them. That threatened to again 
turn the sentiment, when he might have so easily made 
Montson explode. However, he promised his comrade 
to join them if things went on well. 

When Etienne descended the stairs and went out by 
the alley of the house he perceived Easseneur seated in 
front of the hearth, very pale, while his wife, still look- 
ing very grand in her eternal black dress, was speaking 
to him in decisive yet polite words. 

Maheu thought that they should keep their word. 
Such a rendezvous was sacred. Nevertheless the night 
had calmed the fever of them all. He now feared mis- 
fortune; and he explained that their duty was to go 
there to sustain their comrades in the right. La Ma- 
heu approved of what he said. Etienne said with 
complaisance that it was necessary to act revolutionary 
without waiting for any one else. Before going away 
he refused the share of bread which had been given 
them the day before with a bottle of gin; but he drank 
three small glasses of the gin one after the other, to 
keep out the cold; he also carried away a small flask. 
Alzire was to take care of the children. Old Bonne- 
mort, whose legs had given out from the walk of the 
night before remained in bed. 

From prudence they did not all go together. Jeanlin 
had disappeared a long time before. Maheu and his 
wife went ofl: together, while Etienne struck out across 
the forest, wishing to join the comrades whom he ought 
to find there. On the road he met a band of women, 
among whom he recognized old Brule and la Levuque. 
Moquette had brought them some chestnuts and they 
were eating them v.'hile walking on. But in the forest 
he found no one, the men were already at Jean-Bart. 
Then he hastened on and arrived before the mine at the 
moment when Levaque and about a hundred others 
were walking across the flagging. The miners were 
coming from all sides, the Maheus by the main road, 
the women across the fields; all arrived without chiefs, 
without arms, as though it was as natural to collect 
there as for water to run down hill. Etienne perceived 



GERMINAL. 255 

Jeanlin seated on a bridge, as if at a play. He liad rnn 
fast and was among the first to enter. There were 
scarcely three hundred there in all. ' 

" They hesitated wlien Deneulin appeared at the head 
of the stairs leading to the office." 

"What do you want?" said he in a strong voice. 

After having seen the landau disappear, in which his 
daughters were still smiling, he had returned to the 
mine filled with a vague uneasiness. But everything 
there was in good order, the descent had taken place, 
coal was being brought up and he again became easy; 
he was talking with the superintendent when he saw the 
approach of the strikers. He had quickly placed him- 
self behind a window of the screening room, and on 
seeing that crowd enlarge and fill up the flagging, he 
became conscious of his powerlessness. How could he 
defend these buildings which were open on all sides? 
He should scarcely be able to get twenty of his workmen 
around him. He was lost. 

" What do j'^ou want?" he repeated, filled with rage, 
but making an effort to accept this disaster. 

Low growls came from the crowd. Then Etienne 
spoke out, saying: 

" Monsieur, we do not come to hurt you. But it is 
necessary for work to cease everywhere." 

Deneulin treated him like an imbecile. 

" Do you believe you will do me any good if you stop 
work at my mine? It is the same as if you were to fire 
a shot straight into my back. Yes, my men are at the 
bottom, and before they come up you will have to kill 
me." 

That rough speech raised a clamor. Maheu was 
forced to hold Levaque, who became violent, and 
Etienne still talked on trying to convince Deneulin 
that their action was right. But the owner replied 
that work was alone right. However, he refused to 
discuss this foolishness. He wished to be master of his 
own Avorks; his only remorse was that he had not forty 
gendarmes to clean out that mob. 

" It is my own fault, I merit all that happens to me. 
With fellows like you nothing but force will answer. 
It is like the Government who thinks to buy you by 



256 GERMINAL. 

some concessions. You would crush it down when it 
had armed you." 

Etienne trembled, but contained himself. He 
lowered his voice. 

"I beg you, monsieur, to give the order for your 
workmen to come up. I can do nothing with my com- 
rades, and you will save yourself trouble.'" 

" No; leave me to attend to my own affairs. Do I 
know you? You do not belong to my mine. You have 
no right to come here with your strike. You are only 
robbers coming through the country to steal." 

His voice was drowned by the noise, the women 
especially insulted him. He continued to be obstinate, 
feeling a relief in that freshness which emptied his heart 
of authority. It was the ruin of everything, and he 
was not afraid to speak out. But their numbers were 
still increasing, nearly five hundred people were already 
on the spot, and he was going to beat his way through 
them when his superintendent roughly pulled him back, 
saying: 

"Oh, Monsieur! this will be a slaughter. What use 
is it to kill men for nothing?" 

He struggled, he protested in a last cry thrown at the 
mob: 

"You set of thieves! look out when we again become 
the strongest." 

They led him away. In the shoving of the crowd 
those in front were thrown violently against the stair- 
case, of which the hand-rail was broken. It was the 
women who were pushing, screaming and exciting the 
men. The door gave way at once. It was without lock, 
bemg simply shut with a latch. But the staircase was 
too narrow; the crowd could not have been able to enter 
for a long time if the last end of the besiegers had not 
have thought of entering by the other opening. Then 
they spread out over all parts, in the waiting-room, in 
the screening-shed and in the engine-room. In less than 
five minutes the entire mine was theirs; they filled 
every floor, while, with furious gestures and cries, they 
were utterly carried away with the victory over that 
owner who resisted them. 

Maheu, becoming frightened, was one of the first to 
rush up to Etienne, saying: 



GEKMINAL, 257 

"They must not kill him!" 

The latter had already run forward, but when he 
fouud that M. Deneulin had shut himself up in the 
superintendent's room, he answered: 

"After all, would it be our fault? Such madness!" 

Nevertheless, he was filled with uneasiness; still too 
calm to yield himself to the rage of the others. He 
also suffered in his pride of chief in seeing the crowd 
escaping from his authority, becoming enraged at the 
cold execution of the people's will, which he had not 
foreseen. In vain he shouted, telling them to be calm, 
crying that their useless destruction was wrong. 

"To the boilers!" screamed old Brule. "Put out 
the fires!" 

Le vaque, who had found a file, shook it like a sword, 
ruling the tumult by a continued cry: 

"Let's cut the cables! Let's cut the cables!" 

Every one soon repeated it, only Etienne and Maheu 
continued to protest, overwhelmed, speaking in the 
uproar without obtaining silence. At length the first 
was able to say: 

"But there are men at the bottom, comrades!" 

The noise increased; voices cried from all parts. 

"No matter! They had no business to go down! 
It will serve them right! They can stay there! And 
besides there are the ladders! " 

At the thought of the ladders they became all the 
more obstinate and Etienne saw he must yield. In the 
fear of a greater disaster he hastily went toward the 
engine, wishing to at least bring up the cages, so that 
when the cables were cut they would not fall down the 
shaft on those below. The engineer had disappeared, 
also some other workmen employed at the top; and he 
was forced to take possession, running the engine as 
Levaque and two others were climbing up the carpenter 
work which supported the drums. The cages were 
scarcely fastened upon their bolts when they heard the 
squeaking noise of the file sawing the steel. There was 
a great silence, that sound seemed to fill the entire 
mine, everyone raised their heads, watching, listening, 
seized with emotion. As the sound was first heard 
Maheu felt a fierce joy as if tlie teeth of that file was 
delivering them from unhappiness by destroying the 
17 



258 GEKMINAL. 

cable of one of those holes of misery into which they 
would descend no more. 

But old Brule disappeared by the waiting room stair- 
way, still yelling. 

"We must put out the fires, to the boiler room!" 

A number of women followed her. La Maheu has- 
tened after them to prevent them from breaking up 
everything. Just as her man was trying to argue with 
the comrades, so was she the most calm of the women; 
they could demand what was right, without destroying 
everything in other people's buildings. When she en- 
tered the boiler-room, the women had already driven 
away the two firemen, and Brule, armed with a long 
shovel, was squatted before one of the fires, and was 
violently emptying it, throwing the coal out upon the 
bricks, where it still continued to burn with a thick, 
black smoke. In this manner the women went to each 
one of the ten fires. La Levaque worked her shovel 
with both hands, Moquette tucked up her clothes so as 
not to get on fire; they were all blood-red from the re- 
flection of the fire, perspiring and with disordered hair. 
The heap of coal grew into a high pile, while the terri- 
ble heat scorched the ceiling of that vast place. 

" This is enough/' cried la Maheu. " The room is on 
fire." 

** I'm very glad of it/' replied old Brule. '' It'll be 
some good work done. I said I'd make them pay dear 
for the death of my man." 

At that moment they heard the shrill voice of Jean- 
lin, which came from above the boilers: 

" Hold on! I'll put this one out." 

One of the first to enter, he had run among the crowd, 
delighted with fight, seeking what harm he could do; 
and the thought came to him to let olï the steam. The 
streams ascended with the violence of flames of fire, 
the fire boilers were emptied as quick as lightning, hiss- 
ing in such a terrible manner that their ears nearly 
split. Everything disappeared in that steam, the red- 
hot coal became white, the women were no longer more 
than shadows. The child appeared m the gallery alone, 
behind that mass of white foam, with a delighted air 
he contemplated his work, grinning with joy to have 
thus turned loose that hurricane. 



GERMIKAL. 259 

That lasted nearly a quarter of an hour. They threw 
buckets of water on the smoldering coals so all fears of 
fire would be removed. But the rage of the crowd did 
not diminish. Men came down with hammers, after 
the cables were cut; the women had armed themsplves 
with bars of iron; and they spoke of bursting the gen- 
erators, breaking the engines and demolishing the mine. 

Etienne ran around with Maheu. He began to feel 
himself carried away with that hot fever of revenge. 
But he still fought against it, conjuring them to act 
calmly. Now that the cables were cut, the fires out, 
tlie boilers empty, work became impossible. But they 
would not listen to liim, they were going to look for 
something else to destroy when shouts came from a little 
low door which was the opening to the ladders. 

"Down traitors! . . . Oh! the dirty cowards! 
Down with them! down with them." 

It was the beginning of the workmen's exit from the 
bottom. The first dazzled by the bright light, afraid of 
falling in the midst of that howling mob, remained 
where they were with quivering eyelashes. Then they 
ran off, seized with fright, trying to reach the road and 

fly- 

"Down with the cowards! down with the false 
brothers." 

All the strikers had run forward. In less than two 
minutes, not a man remained in the buildings, the five 
hundred from Montson ranged themselves in two lines, 
to force the men of Vaudame to pass between them. 
And, as each new miner appeared at the opening with 
his clothing wet and stained with the black mud of 
their work, the hooting increased. Then they saw 
Cheval standing before them. 

"Great God! is this the meeting you called us to?" 

And they tried to throw themselves on the traitor. 
What ! only the day before he had sworn to be one of 
them, and now they had found him at the bottom in 
company with the traitors. This was how he made fun 
of the people. 

"Bring him out! bring him out!" 

Cheval, pale with fright, tried to explain himself, but 
Etienne interrupted him. He was now aroused by the 
fury of the mob. 



260 GERMINAL. 

"You wanted to be one of ns, and so you shall be. 
Come on out, rascal." 

Another clamor drowned his voice. Catherine had 
just appeared, also dazzled by the bright sun and afraid 
of falling in the midst of those savages. And, with legs 
nearly broken from the hundred and two ladders, her 
hands bleeding, she was gasping for breath, when her 
mother, on seeing her, threw herself upon her, throwing 
out her hands. 

''Ah! you too, wench. . . . When your mother 
is dying of hunger you betray her for your lover." 

Maheu, to prevent her from hitting the girl, held her 
hands. But he also reproached the girl, crying at her 
as loud as the comrades. 

The sight of Catherine even exasperated Etienne. 
He cried: 

"Let us go to the other mines! And you shall come 
with us, too, traitors." 

Again a deafening tumult broke forth. Cheval 
scarcely had time to go to the room and put on his shoes 
and fling his coat over his frozen shoulders. They 
dragged him on, forcing him to run among the others. 
Catherine, distracted, also put on her jacket, and then 
ran behind her lover. She would not leave him, for 
they were surely going to kill him. 

In a few minutes Jean-Bart was empty. Jeanlin 
who had found a call-horn was blowing on it as if he 
was calling the cows. The women Brule, la Levaque, 
and Moquette ran off together. Other comrades were 
still arriving, there were almost a thousand now, with- 
out order, without chief, running en the road like an 
overflown stream. The way out was too narrow and 
fences were broken down. Outside in the strong air 
the cries seemed still louder. 

"To the mines! Down with the traitors! No more 
work ! " 

At Jean-Bart a great silence had suddenly fallen. 
Not a sound was heard. Deneulin went out of the 
superintendent's room and all alone, sending the others 
back with a gesture when they would have followed 
him, he went over the mine. His rage gone he was 
now very calm but pale. First he stopped at the shaft, 
and raising his eyes he looked at the cut cables, the 



GERMINAL. 261 

ends of steel hanging useless, the file had done its work, 
leaving a fresh cut which shone out from the black 
grease. 

Then he went up to the engine and for a long time 
conteuijilated the crank stopped in mid air, equal to a 
large body struck with paralysis; and on touching the 
already cold metal, which was so cold as to make him 
shiver, lie felt as though he was touching a dead body. 
Then he went to the boiler-room, walked slowly before 
the fires v\'hich had been put out, and then flooded. He 
touched the generators with his foot, and they sounded 
empty, though the steam was still coming from them. 
It was over. His ruin was comjîlete. Even if he 
mended the cables; if he again lit the fires, where 
would he find men to work? He was ruined. And in 
that certainty of his disaster, he no longer felt a hatred 
for the miners of Montson. This owner, a brave man, 
was intelligent enough to see that it was a general fault. 
They were brutes, without doubt, but brutes who did 
not know how to read and were dying of hunger. 



CHAPTER XXVII. 



AcEOSS the level plain, all white with the frost, 
under the j^ale winter sun, the mob went off, running 
along the roads and across the beet-fields. 

From the Fourche-aux-Bœufs Etienne had taken 
command of ihem. Without stopping, he called out 
his orders, and organized the march. Jeanlin ran on 
ahead, blowing his horn. In the first ranks were the 
women, some armed with sticks ; la Maheu, with 
savage eyes, seemed to seek from afar the city of j)rom- 
ised justice; old Brule, la Levaque, and Moquette 
stalked along like soldiers going to war. In case they 
met the gendarmes, they would see if they would beat 
back the women. And the men followed m a confused 
flock, a straggling line v/hich constantly enlarged, 
armed with bars of iron, led by Levaque, carrying an 
axe, the edge of wliich shone in the sun. In the 
center, Etienne never lost sight of Cheval, whom he 
forced to walk before him; while Maheu, behind, with 



262 GERMINAL. 

a gloomy air, now and then glanced at Catherine, the 
only woman among those men. But she was deter- 
mined to walk near her lover, so that they could do 
him no harm. Their bare heads were disheveled by 
the wind; nothing was heard but the sound of their 
wooden shoes, which was like the gallop of cattle, 
carried away by the sound of Jeanlin's horn. 

All at once, a new cry arose. 

''Bread! bread! bread!" 

It was noon; the hunger of that six weeks strike had 
awakened as they ran across those fields. The small 
crust of bread, eaten in the morning, and the few chest- 
nuts which Moquette had given the women, were not 
enough, and now hunger was added to their rage, 

"To the mines! no more work! bread"! " 

Etienne, who had refused to eat his share that morn- 
ing, began to feel a gnawing in his stomach. He did 
not complain, but every moment he took out his flask 
and swallowed a small quantity of gin. He was so 
weak that he could not have gone on without it. Then 
his cheeks began to burn and a flame lit up his eyes. 
But he kept his head; he still wished to avoid useless 
devastation. 

As they reached the Joiselle road, a Vandame miner 
who had joined the band wanted to go to the right, 
and yelled: 

"To Gaston-Marie! we must stop the pumps so that 
the water will flood Jean-Bart." 

The enraged mob had already turned in spite of the 
appeals of Etienne, who implored them to let that 
alone. What good would it do to destroy the galleries? 
that roused his workingman's heart. Maheu also 
thought it unjust; but the miner still shouted, and 
Etienne, trying to drown his voice, screamed with all 
his might. 

" To Mison! there are sc.rne traitors at the bottom of 
Mison! . . . to Mison!" 

With a gesture he drove the crowd back, while Jean- 
lin still blew the horn; and Gaston-Marie, for the time 
at least, was saved. 

The five kilometres which separated them from 
Gaston-Marie were crossed in a quarter of an hour. It 
was a foot race across the broad plain. The canal on 



GERMINAL. 263 

the side of the plain was covered with ice, and the trees 
on the bank covered with frost looked like huge can- 
delabra. A small hill hid Montson and Marchiennes, 
while before them extended a boundless level. When 
they arrived at the mine they saw an overseer standing 
near the screening shed to receive them. They all 
recognized old Qnandieu, the oldest overseer in Mont- 
son, a venerable man with white skin and hair, who at 
seventy years of age was a very miracle of good health. 

" What do you want here, you mob of mischief 
makers?" said he, in a voice which was still strong. 

The crowd stopped. This was not an owner, but a 
comrade; and respect for that old workman restrained 
them. 

" There are some men at the bottom," said Etienne. 
" Make them come out." 

"Yes there are some men at the bottom," answered 
Quandieu; "there are about seventy-five, the others 
were afraid of you rascals! . . . But I warn you, 
not one will come out; you can attend to your business 
with me." 

Growls were heard, the men pushed and the women 
advanced. The overseer quickly stepped forward to bar 
the door. 

Then Maheu interfered. 

" Old man it's our right; how can we make the strike 
general if we do not force our comrades to join us?" 

For an instant the old man remained silent. Evi- 
dently his ignorance in matters of coalition equaled 
that of the digger. At length he replied: 

"I don't say it's not your right. But I have my 
orders. ... I am alone here. The men do not 
come up until three o'clock, and they shall stay there 
until then." 

His last words were drowned in the shouts. They 
threatened him with their fists; the women already 
deafened him; and he felt their hot breaths on his face. 
But he was courageous; with head erect, showing his 
large mustache and white hair, he spoke out so dis- 
tinctly that he was heard above all that uproar. 

"No, my God! You shall not pass! ... As 
true as the sun shines upon us, I would rather die than 
let the cables be touched. . . . Do not push any 



364 GERMIJSTAL. 

more, or I'll throw myself in the shaft before your 
eyes/' 

The crowd trembled and paused; then they moved 
back as he continued: 

" Don't you understand? I'm only a workman like 
all of you. They told me to stand guard, and I do so." 

His intelligence went no further; tliis old man well 
understood his military duty and he straightened him- 
self up and looked at them out of eyes dimmed with a 
gloomy sadness by reason of the half century spent at 
the bottom. His comrades watched him moved, having 
somewhere in them the echo of what he had said; that 
soldier-like obedience, that devotion and resignation in 
danger. He believed that they were hesitating and he 
repeated his words: 

" I'll throw myself in the shaft before you." 

They turned away and ran off up the road; and then 
their cries again rang out: 

"To the Madeleine ! to Crevecœur ! no more work! 
bread ! bread ! " 

But in the madness of the march they began to shove 
each other. Some one said that Cheval was trying to 
escape. Etienne caught his arm, threatening to break 
his back if he attempted any treachery. Cheval strug- 
gled and protested violently. 

" Wliy all this? ain't a man free any longer? . 
I'm freezing, and I want to wash myself. Let me alone." 

In reality he was suffering from the coal dust which 
the perspiration had stuck to his skin, and his knit 
jacket protected him but little. 

"Go on; we'll wash you," answered Etienne. 

They were still running; at last he turned towards 
Catherine. It made him desperate to feel her near him, 
to know that she was so miserable, shivering under her 
old blouse, and with muddy pants. She must be nearly 
dead with fatigue. But, all the same, she ran on. 

" You can go, if you want to," said he finally. 

She did not seem to hear. Her eyes, on meeting 
those of Etienne, flamed up with reproach. Slie did 
not stop. Did he wish her to abandon her man? Sure, 
Cheval was not very good to her, and beat her some- 
times; but he was her man, the one she had accepted. 



GERMINAL. 265 

and it enraged her that all these people were against 
him; from pride, not tenderness, she would defend him. 

"Go away!^' said Maheu. 

This order from her father made her pause an instant. 
She trembled, and tears fell from her eyes. But she 
went forward again and took her old place behind her 
lover. Then they let her stay. 

After following the Joiselle road for some distance, 
they turned off toward Coagny. Off that way manufact- 
uring chimneys stood out on the fiat horizon; some 
sheds of tarred wood and brick workshops, covered with 
coal dust, followed each other in rapid succession. 
From time to time they passed alleys filled with low 
houses, the Deux-Cent-Vingt, then the Joixante-Seize; 
and from each one, at the call of the horn, joined in the 
clamor of the people; families came out, men, women 
and children, who also fell in behind their comrades. 
When they arrived at the Madeleine there were quite 
thirteen hundred of them. The road descended a 
smooth slope, and the murmuring crowd of strikers vv^as 
compelled to go over a large square of ground before 
reaching the mine. 

At that moment it was little more than two o'clock, 
but the overseers, having been warned, had hastened 
the ascent; and when the mob arrived nearly every one 
was out of the mine; there only remained in the pit 
about twenty men, who were soon disembarked from the 
cage. They followed them, throwing stones after 
them. Two men were knocked down, another left witli 
them a sleeve of his jacket. This chase after the men 
saved the materials. They touched neither the cables 
nor the boilers. Then the crowd pressed on to the 
next mine. 

The Crèvecœur was only five hundred metres from 
the Madeleine. There the mob also fell on them just 
as they were leaving the mine. A girl was beaten by 
the women; the boys were slapped as they went by; the 
men ran off with their sides black and blue and noses 
bleeding. And, in the increasing ferocity, that wish 
for revenge which had turned all their heads, the cries 
of death to the traitors continued. They tried to cut 
the cables, but the file did not work; it was too long. 



266 GEEMINAL. 

Now that the fever was on them, they would go to 
extremes. 

A tap was broken in the boilers, while bucketsful of 
water were thrown in the fire, which burst the iron. 

Outside, they talked of going to Saint Thomas. That 
mine was the best disciplined of all. The strike scarcely 
reached it. Nearly seven hundred men must have goue 
to work there that morning; and this incensed the mob. 
They would have a battle with bricks to see who should 
remain on the ground. But a report was circulated that 
the gendarmes were at Saint Thomas — those same gend- 
armes who had been before the alley in the morniug, 
and whom they had mocked. How did they know that? 
No one could vouch for it, for they had not been there. 
No matter, they were seized with fear, and decided to 
go to Feutry-Cantel. So they went, rushing off on the 
road to that mine, crying, "To Feutry-Cantel! to Feu- 
try-Cantel! The cowards are still there." 

Feutry-Cantel was situated about three kilometres off, 
in the valley of the Scarpe. They were already on the 
hill near the Platriéres, beyond the Baugnies road, when 
an unknown voice said that the gendarmes were there 
also. Then, from one end of the line to the other, it 
,was repeated that the gendarmes were there. Their 
steps slackened; a panic was coming on them across 
the country, silent, from the stoppage of work which 
they had brought on. Wliy had they not yet come 
across the gendarmes? This impunity troubled them 
with the thought of repression which they felt was 
coming. 

Without their knowing why, a new order was sent 
along the line. 

''To la Victoire! to la Victoire!" 

Their were no gendarmes there. All were reassured 
and, turning round, they descended the hill toward 
Montoise, cutting across the fields to again reach the 
Joiselle road. A railroad obstructed their way; they 
crossed it by breaking down the fences. Now, they 
were again approaching Montson; a small hill was 
before them, while in the distance were seen the black 
houses of Marchiennes. 

This time they had a run of five long kilometres. 
They were so excited that their fatigue was not felt, 



GEKMINAL. 267 

and they were unaware that their feet were bruised and 
frost-bitten. The crowd was always increased by the 
comrades picked up in the roads and alleys. When 
they had passed over the canal by the Magache bridge, 
and had arrived at la Victoire they numbered two 
thousand But three o'clock had struck; the men had 
come up; not a man remained at the bottom. Vain 
threats were uttered, but they were only able to drive 
ofl with their brickbats the workmen who had come to 
take the place of the gang that had been relieved. 
These men ran away, and the deserted mine was in 
their possession. In their rage at not having one of 
the traitors to beat, they attacked the mine. The 
grudge which had been slowly gathering in their hearts 
burst forth. After years and years of hunger they 
would have their revenge in destroying all. 

Behind a shed Etienne perceived some loaders who 
were filling a coal car. 

"Will you go away!" cried he. "'Not a piece shall 
be moved." 

Under his orders a hundred of the strikers ran for- 
ward; and the men had only time to save themselves. 
The horses were unharnessed and allowed to run away; 
while the cars were u-pset and broken. 

Levaque, with violent blows of his axe, attacked the 
trestles which held up the bridges. Then the idea oc- 
curred to tear up the car tracks. Soon the entire band 
was at this work. Maheu tore up the flagstones with 
his bar of iron, which served him as a crowbar. 

In the meantime old Brule led the women to the 
lamp room, where they broke up the lamps, la Maheu 
and la Levaque assisting. They were all soaked with 
oil, and Moquette wiped her hand on her skirt laughing 
at being so dirty. Jeanlin had emptied a lamp down 
her back. 

But this vengeance gave them nothing to eat. And 
the cries broke forth once more: 

"Bread! bread! bread!" 

At la Victoire an old overseer had left his bucket be- 
hind him. Without doubt, taken with fear, he had 
abandoned the building in haste. When the women 
returned and the men had finished destroying the road, 
they grasped the bucket; the top was removed at once. 



268 GERMINAL. 

But they found no bread; there were only two pieces of 
raw meat, and some potatoes. But in looking around 
they found fifty bottles of gin, which disappeared like 
a drop of water drank up by the sand. 

Etienne, who had emptied his flask, was able to refill 
it. Little by little a terrible intoxication, the intoxica- 
tion of hunger had made his eyes blood shot, and, like 
a wolf, his teeth sbone out between his pale lips. Sud- 
denly he perceived that Cheval had run away in the 
midst of the tumult. He swore, and some of the men 
ran and brought back the fugitive, whom they found 
with Catherine concealed behind a lot of wood. 

" So you're afraid of compromising yourself, are you? 
you rascal!" yelled Etienne. "In the forest didn't you 
speak of the engineers' strike and say it would stop the 
engines? And now you try to get out of our way? 
. . . "Well; we're going to return to Gaston-Marie, 
and you can break that engine yourself. Yes, you shall 
break it." 

He was drunk, he turned himself and his men against 
the very engine which he had saved some hours before. 

"To Gaston-Marie! to Gaston-Marie!" 

Every one applauded him, and Cheval was seized by 
the shoulders, dragged and violently pushed along, 
while he still asked that he be allovred to wash. 

" Go way now," cried Maheu to Catherine, who had 
again begun to run. 

She threw angry looks at her father and continued to 
run on. 

The band again went over the smooth plain and then 
through the long straight roads spreading out over 
the country. It was four o'clock; the sun was going 
down, leaving upon the frozen ground the shadows of 
the mob with their furious gestures. 

On passing Montson, they went further up the 
Joiselle road; and, to avoid the turn at Fourche-aux- 
Boeufs, they passed the walls of Piolaine. The Gre- 
goires had just started out to call on some friends, 
before going to dine with the Hennebeaus, where they 
were to meet Cécile. The property seemed asleep 
with its avenue of limes and its deserted garden and 
orchard. Everything was quiet in the house, even the 
windows being closed; and from that profound silencç 



GERMINAL. 269 

arose a suggestion of happiness and well being, the 
thought of good beds, a good table, and the joy, dis- 
creet and without luxury, in which the lives of the 
owners were passed. 

Without pausing the crowd cast threatening looks 
over the iron railings, along the protecting walls, and 
even on the white front of the house. The cries again 
commenced: 

"Bread! bread! bread!" 

The dogs alone replied by ferocious barks; they were 
a pair of large Danish dogs, having a tawiiy coat, who 
stood erect with open jaws. Behind a closed shutter 
there were the two maids, Melaine, the cook, and 
Honorine, the chambermaid; who, attracted by the cry, 
turned pale when they saw those savages. They fell on 
their knees; they thought they were goiug to be killed 
on hearing a stone, only one, break a pane of glass in a 
neighboring Avindow. This was a trick of Jeanlin's; he 
had made a sling with a piece of cord and was only 
firing a salute to the Gregoires as he passed then* house. 
He had already begun blowing his horn again, and the 
cry grew lower as the crowd moved off in the distance. 

"Bread! bread! bread!" 

On arriving at Gaston-Marie, with a still larger body 
of two thousand five hundred enraged men, they broke 
everything around them, with the increased force of a 
falling stone. Some gendarmes had passed there an 
hour before; but they had gone on to Saint Thomas, 
misinformed by the peasants; and in their haste they 
had not even taken the j^recaution to leave a squad of 
men to guard this mine. In less than a quarter of an 
hour the fires were destroyed, the boilers emptied, and 
the buildings overrun and devastated. But it was 
especially the engine that they attacked. It was not 
sufficient for it to stop with the last expiring breath of 
steam; but they threw themselves upon it as on a living 
person, whose life they sought. 

"You shall strike the first blow! " said Etienne, put- 
ting a hammer in the hand of Cheval. " Come on, now, 
you swore with the others." 

Cheval tremblingly drew back and the hammer fell; 
but his comrades, without waiting, beat the engine with 
blows of their iron bars, with bricks and everything 



;J7U GERMINAL. 

they could lay their hands on; some even knocked on it 
with sticks. The screws were loosened, the pieces of 
steel and brass were knocked oft'. A heavy blow of an 
axe, given with all the strength of their strongest man, 
broke to pieces the iron tank of the engine, and, as the 
water escaped and it became empty, there came forth a 
rattling sound like a person in his death agony. 

That was the end; the mob went outside, crazy, run- 
ning behind Etienne, who had not yet let go of Cheval. 

" Death to the traitor! To the shaft! to the shaft! '' 

The miserable man became livid, stammering some 
explanations, and then going back to the stupid idea 
that he must wash himself. 

"Wait, if that's what makes you uncomfortable," 
said la Levaque. " Why, here are the buckets." 

There was a pond there, made from the water which 
ran from the engine. It was white with a thick layer 
of ice. They pushed him to it, broke the ice and 
forced him to stick his head into the cold water. 

"Dive in now," said old Brule. "My God! if you 
don't get in we'll put you in. . . . And now you 
shall drink some; yes, yes, like a beast with its nose in 
the trough." 

He was forced to lie down and drink. They all 
laughed with the unconscious laugh of cruelty. One 
woman pulled his ears ; another threw a handful of 
frozen mud in his face. His old jacket came apart. 
And, almost wild, he fell upon them, giving blows right 
and left to get away. 

Maheu had pushed him, la Maheu was among the 
most violent; both were satisfying the old grudge they 
had against him; and Moquette, who usually was good 
friends with all her old lovers, was so enraged at this one 
that she did everything she could to him. 

Then Etienne cried out: 

"You have all done enough now. I want to have 
my revenge." 

And turning to Cheval: 

"If you wish we'll fight it out together." 

His hands closed, his eyes were lit up with the fury 
of a homicide, as if the drink which he had taken had 
made him. wish to murder. 



GERMIXAL. 271 

'^ Are you ready? One of n s shall fall here. . . . 
Give him a knife. I have mine." 

Catherine, exliansted and in fear, looked at him and 
she remembered his confidences that first day when 
they had talked of his wish to kill as soon as he drank. 
She ran forward, and held hhn back with both hands, 
crying to him, filled wilh anger. 

"Let him alone! This is too much. You want to 
kill him now that he can't stand up." 

She turned toward her father and mother; she turned 
toward all the others. 

"You are cowards! cowards! Kill me too. I'll 
mash your faces, if you touch him again. Oh! you 
cowards." 

And she stood before her man and defended him, 
forgetting the blow, forgetting the life of misery, roused 
at the thought that she belonged to him, and that it 
was her shame, when he was treated thus. 

Etienne, under the taunts of the girl, had become 
very pale. At first he would have liked to strangle her; 
then, after wiping his face, he said to Cheval in the 
midst of great silence: 

"She's right. That's enough. Go away." 

Cheval at once began to run, and Catherine started 
after him. The crowd watched them disappear at a 
bend in the road; only la Maheu complained. 

"You're wrong; you ought to have kept him. He'll 
surely go and play traitor again." 

But the crowd had resumed the march. Five o'clock 
sounded; the sun, bright red, was at the edge of the 
horizon, casting blood-red stains over that immense 
plain. A pedler who was passing told them that the 
dragoons were coming over the Crevècœur road. Then 
they turned back, and the order ran: 

"To Montson! to the directors! Bread! bread! 
bread!" 



CHAPTER XXVIII. 



M. Hexxebeau had placed himself at the window 
of his office to see the departure of the carriage which 
was taking his wife to breakfast at Marchiennes, after 



27;i GERMINAL. 

sto2D])ing at the Gregoires and at tlie Deneulins to take 
up the young ladies. He had watched Mégrel for an 
instant, on horseback, trotting near the carriage door; 
then he had returned and quietly seated himself at his 
desk. With neither his Avife nor his nephew to cheer 
him with their noisy bustle, the house seemed empty. 
The coachman was driving Madame; Rose, the new 
chamber-maid, had a holiday until five o'clock; and 
there only remained Hypolite, the valet-de-chambre, 
dragging his slij^pcrs through the rooms, and the cook, 
entirely absorbed since daybreak in the dinner which 
his masters were giving tliat evening. Therefore M. 
Hennebeau promised himself a good day's work in the 
profound silence of the deserted house. 

Towards nine o'clock, notwithstanding that he had 
received orders to admit no one, Hypolite took the lib- 
erty of announcing Dansaert, who said he brought 
serious news. It was only then the director learned 
of the meeting held the previous evening in the for- 
est of Vandame; and the details were so minute, 
that he listened to him with a feeble, unconscious 
smile, thinking of the amours of la Pieronne, so well 
known that two or three anonymous letters every week 
denounced to him the wanderings of tl^e master over- 
seer. Evidently the husband had talked; he had strong 
suspicions. He embraced this opportunity, and let it 
be understood that he knew all, but contented himself 
with recommending prudence, for fear of a scandal, 
which would force him to act. Startled by this remon- 
strance in the midst of his report, Dansaert denied, 
stammered out excuses, while his huge nose confessed 
the crime by its sudden redness. For the rest, he did 
not insist, glad to get off so cheaply; for usually the di- 
rector displayed the implacable severity of a pure man, as 
soon as an employe amused himself with a pretty girl in a 
mine. Conversation continued on the strike; that meet- 
ing in the forest was as yet but the blustering of brag- 
garts, no serious danger threatened. In any case the 
alleys would not stir that day, because of the respectful 
fear with which they had been im2:)ressed by the mili- 
tary display that morning. 

When M. Hennebeau found himself alone again, he 
was, nevertheless, on the point of sending a dispatch to 



GERMIKAL. 273 

the Prefect. The fear of giving an unnecessary sign of 
iinpasiness restrained him. He had not yet forgiven 
himself for having failed to scent it; for having said 
everywhere, for having even written to the owners, that 
the strike would not last a fortnight at the most. To 
his great surprise it had gone on for nearly two months; 
and he was in despair about it; lie felt himself daily 
growing weaker, compromised, forced to seek for some 
brilliant stroke if he wished to regain the favor of the 
managers. He had just asked for precise orders in the 
event of a dispute. The answer was delayed; he was 
expecting it by the afternoon courier. And he said to 
himself that it would be time enough then to issue tele- 
grams for the military occupation of the mines, if such 
should be the advice of those gentlemen. In his opinion, 
it would certainly be a battle ending in bloodshed and 
death; and a proportionate responsibility troubled him, 
in spite of his habitual energy. 

Up to eleven o'clock he worked quietly without any 
other noise in the dead house than Hypolite's waxing 
stick far off in a room at the other end. But, one fol- 
lowing the other, he received two dispatciies, the first 
announcing the invasion of Jean-Bart by the band from 
Montson, the second telling of the cables cut, fires put 
out, in fact all the vandalism. He did not understand. 
What were the strikers doing at Deneulin's, instead of 
attacking one of the company's mines? As for the 
rest, the pillaging of Vandame was of no consequence; 
it would ripen the plan for conquest which he Avas med- 
itating. And at noon he lunched, all alone in the vast 
dining-room, served in silence by the servant whose 
steps he did not even hear. 

This silence deepened his preoccupation; he felt him- 
self chilled to the heart when an overseer, running at 
full speed, was introduced and told him of the march 
of the mob upon Miron. Just as he was finishing his 
coffee a telegram informed him that la Madeleine and 
Crevecœur were menaced in their turn. Then his 
perplexity became extreme. He expected the courier 
at two o'clock; ought he to ask for troops immediately? 
"Would it not be better to wait a little longer, so as not 
to take any action before knowing the orders of the 
managers? He returned to his office; he wished to 



274 GERMIlSrAL. 

read a note which he had charged Mégrel to write for 
the Prefect the previous evening. As he could not 
find it he thouglit the young man might have left it in 
his room, where he often wrote at night before going to 
bed. And without coming to any decision, thinking 
only about this paper, he went up to the room above to 
look for it. 

On entering it, M. Hennebeau was surprised; the 
room had not been put in order, doubtless from forget- 
fulness or from idleness on the part of Ilypolite, left 
alone by the absence of the maid servant. A moist 
warmth prevailed there, the inclosed heat of a whole 
night, aggravated by the open register of the furnace; 
it attacked his nostrils, and he suffocated with a pene- 
trating perfume which he thought was the odor from 
the numerous bottles of perfume on the toilet table. 
The room was in great disorder, clothes scattered about, 
wet towels thrown over the backs of the chairs, and the 
bed unmade, one sheet drawn off dragging on the car- 
pet. At first he hardly noticed all this; he had gone to 
a little table encumbered with papers, and was looking 
for the missing note. Twice he examined the papers, 
one by one; certainly it was not there. Where could 
that idiot Paul have hid it. 

As M. Hennebeau returned to the middle of the room 
giving a coup cV œil to each piece of furniture, he per- 
ceived in the open bed a sharp point which shone like a 
spark. He approached mechanically and put his hand 
in. There, under two folds of the sheet, bruised, 
crushed, was a small gold flacon. He immediately 
recognized it as a flacon of Madame Hennebeau's; the 
flacon of ether which never left her. But he did not 
yet understand how that article could have been in 
Paul's bed. Suddenly he became frightfully pale; his 
wife had been there. 

" Pardon," murmured Hypolite's voice on the other 
side of the door, *'I saw Monsieur go up." 

He had come in, the sight of the room filled him 
with consternation. 

*'My God! it's true, the room is not done up! And 
Eose went out leaving all the work on my back." 

M. Hennebeau had hidden the flacon in his hand, 
clenching it tightly. 



GEEMIXAL. 275 

^'Whatdoyou want?" 

"Monsieur^ there's another man. . . . He comes 
from Crevecœur; there is a letter/' 

*' Very well! leave me, tell him to wait." 

His wife had been there! When he had secured the 
bolt, he looked at the flacon, which had left a red mark 
on his flesh. Suddenly he saw, he understood; this 
game had been carried on at his house for two months 
past. He remembered his old suspicion. Yes! it was 
his wife who had been there! 

Falling on a chair in front of the bed at which he 
was looking fixedly, he remained for long minutes as if 
stunned. A noise aroused him; they were knocking at 
the door, trying to open it. Again he recognized 
Hypolite's voice. "Monsieur. . . . Ah! Monsieur 
has locked himself in. . . ." 

*' What is it now?" 

" It seems urgent, the workmen are breaking every- 
thing. Two other men are below. These are dis- 
patches also." 

" Let me have peace! In a moment!" 

The thought that Hypolite would himself have dis- 
covered the flacon, if he had made the bed in the morn- 
ing, ran through him like a chill. And besides, he must 
know; he must have often seen the same traces of her 
presence. If he seemed eager to come up, it was from 
malice. Perhaps he had remained with his ear at the 
door, enlivened by the disgrace of his master. Then, 
M. Hennebeau was motionless again. He again sunk 
on a chair, looking ever at the bed. The long suffering 
of the past came before him; his marriage with this 
woman; their immediate discord in mind and body; the 
lovers she had had beyond a doubt; the one whom he 
had tolerated during ten years, as we tolerate the de- 
praved taste of a sick person. Then came their arrival 
at Montson; a foolish hope of curing her; months of 
languishing, of drowsy exile; the approach of old age 
which would return her to him at last. Then their 
nephew appeared; that Paul to whom she became a 
mother, to whom she spoke of her dead heart, buried 
under the ashes forever. And, imbecile husband, he 
foresaw nothing; he adored this woman who belonged 
to him, whom other men had had, whom he alone could 



276 GERMINAL. 

not have; he adored her with a blind passion, even to 
falling on his knees, if she would only take him after 
the others! And after the others, she took this child! 

The stroke of a bell in the distance, at this moment, 
made M. Hennebeau shiver. He recognized it as the 
signal given by his o.rder3 on the arrival of the courier. 
He rose, he spoke aloud in a stream of coarse words 
with which his aching throat was bursting. 

"Ah! I don't care for their dispatches and their 
letters!" 

Then he was seized with rage. He wanted a sewer to 
push in all these impurities with his heel. This woman 
was shameless. He sought for uncoined words to apply 
to her. Suddenly the idea of the marriag:e which she 
was so tranquilly arranging between Cécile and Paul 
completed his madness. There was then no longer even 
any passion, any jealousy at the bottom of this change- 
ful sensuality? At this hour it was only a plaything, 
a need of a lover-like recreation taken as the usual 
dessert. He blamed her for everything, almost exoner- 
ating the child whom she had bitten in this reawakened 
appetite as one bites the first ripe fruit stolen on the 
road. Whom would she eat, how far would she fall 
when she could no longer have complaisant nephews 
practical enough to accept in their family, board, bed, 
and wife? There was a timid scraping at the door, and 
the voice of Hypolite whispered through the key-hole: 

''Monsieur, the courier. . . . and M. Dansaert 
has also returned, and says that they are killing each 
other. ..." 

"My God! I'm going down!" 

What should he do to them? Drive them out on 
their return from Marchiennes like two unclean beasts 
whom he would no longer have under his roof. He 
would arm himself with a cudgel and would command 
them to carry elsewhere the poison of their association. 

It was from their sighs, their united respirations, that 
the heaviness of the warm moisture of the room arose, 
the penetrating odor which had suffocated him. It was 
the scent of musk which his wife's person exhaled, 
another perverse taste, the vulgar need of strong per- 
fumes. Every article in the room seemed to bear witness 



GERMINAL. 277 

to the crime. In a rage at his own impotence, he threw 
himself on the bed, beating it with both fists. 

But suddenly he thought he heard Hypolite coming 
up again. Shame stopped him. He remained there a 
moment longer, out of breath, wiping his forehead, 
calming his fast-beating heart. Standing before a 
mirror, he looked at his face, so discomposed that he 
could not recognize it, a prey to sorrow and fear. 
Then, when he had seen it grow gradually calmer, by a 
strong effort of will, he slowly descended. 

Below, five messengers were standing, without count- 
ing Dansaert. All brought him tidings of increasing 
gravity respecting the march of the strikers around the 
mines; and the master overseer related to him at length 
what had taken place at Miron, saved by the noble 
conduct of old Quandieu. He listened; he shook his 
head, but he understood nothing; his mind was up- 
stairs in the room. At last, he dismissed them. He 
said he was going to take necessary measures. When 
he found himself alone again, seated before his desk, he 
appeared to doze, his head between his hands, his eyes 
hidden. His courier was there, and he decided to 
examine there the expected letter, the reply of the 
owners, the lines of which danced at first. Neverthe- 
less, he at last understood that those gentlemen wanted 
a collision. True, they did not tell him to make mat- 
ters worse; but they let it be seen that outbreaks would 
hasten the end of the strike, by provoking energetic 
repression. 

He hesitated no longer; he sent out dispatches in all 
directions to the prefect of Lille, to the corps of troops 
at Douai, to the gendarmerie of Marchiennes. It was 
a relief to him; he had to shut himself up at home; he 
even gave it out that he was suffering from gout. And 
all the afternoon he hid himself at the back of his office, 
receiving no one, contenting himself with reading the 
dispatches and letters which continued to rain in upon 
him. Thus from afar, he followed the mob from the 
Madeleine to Crevecoeur, from Crevecœur to la Victoire, 
from la Victoire to Gaston-Marie. From another 
quarter, he received information of the fight of the 
gendarmes and of the dragoons, wandering on the 
road, always turning their backs on the attacked mines. 



378 GERMINAL. 

They might throttle each other and destroy everything; 
he had again put his head down between his hands, his 
fingers over his eyes; he was wrapped in the profound 
silence of the house, which nothing broke except the 
occasional rattle of the sauce pans in the kitchen by 
the cook, in vigorous action before the fire, preparing her 
dinner for the evening. Twilight already darkened the 
room; it was five o'clock, when a tumult made M. Hen- 
nebeau tremble, dizzy, inert, his elbows still in his 
papers. He thought it was the two wretches returning. 
But the tumult increased; a terrible cry arose at the 
moment he was approaching the window. 

** Bread! bread! bread!" 

It was the strikers who were invading Montson, 
whilst the gendarmes, believing in an attack on le 
Voreux, galloped, with their backs turned, to occupy 
that mine. Exactly at the distance of two kilometres 
from the first houses, a little below the meeting of the 
highway and the road to Vandame, Madame Henne- 
beau and the young ladies had just witnessed the pass- 
ing of the band. The day at Marchiennes had passed 
gaily; a pleasant breakfast at the house of the director 
of les Forges; then an interesting visit to the workshops 
and to the glass-works in the vicinity to fill up the 
afternoon; and, as they were returning at last in the 
clear evening light of a fine winter's day, Cécile was 
taken with a fancy to drink a cup of milk when passing 
near a little farm skirting the road. All then got out 
of the landau, Megrel gallantly jumping from his horse; 
while the peasant woman, bewildered by this gay com- 
pany, rushed in saying she would spread a table-cloth 
before waiting on them. But Lucie and Jeanne wished 
to see the milking; they even went to the stable with 
their cups; they had a partie champêtre of it, laughing 
much at the litter in which they found themselves. 

Madame Hennebeau, with her complacent matronly 
air, was drinking with the tips of her lips, when a 
strange noise outside made her uneasy. 

''What is that?" 

The stable, built on the edge of the a*oad, had a large 
door for the carts, for it served at the same time as a 
barn for hay. 

Already the young girls, stretching out their heads. 



GERMINAL. 379 

were astonished as they distinguished to the left a black 
wave, a howling crowd streaming from the Vandame 
road. 

"The devil!" muttered Megrel; "are our brawlers 
going to end by getting angry?" 

" Perhaps it's the coalmen again," said the peasant 
woman. " This is the second time they have passed. 
Things don't go well it appears; they are the masters of 
the country." 

Each word was carefully spoken; she watched the ef- 
fect on their faces, and when she saw the terror of all, 
the profound anxiety into which this incident had 
thrown them, she hastened to add: 

"Oh, the rascals! the rascals! " 

Megrel, seeing that it was too late to reenter the car- 
riage and reach Montson, ordered the coachman to 
bring the landau quickly into the farm -yard, where the 
horses remained concealed behind a barn. He tied his 
own horse under this barn, a boy having hitherto held 
it by the bridle. When he returned he found his aunt 
and the young girls bewildered, ready to follow the 
peasant, who proposed that they should take refuge at 
her house. But it was his opinion that they were safer 
where they were; that no one would come to look for 
them among this hay. The cart door, however, shut 
very badly, and there were such crevices between its 
rotten plaaks that from the interior everything that 
passed on the road could be seen. 

"Come! courage!" said he, trying to turn the ad- 
venture into a jest. " We'll sell our lives dearly." 

His laugh increased their fear; the noise grew louder; 
nothing was seen yet, but on the empty road, a stormy 
wind seemed rising already, like the sudden gusts which 
precede great tempests. 

"No, no, I don't want to look," said Cécile, throwing 
herself in the hay, her hands over her eyes, as she would 
cover them to shut out the lightning. Madame Henne- 
beau, very pale, enraged with these people who again 
spoiled one of her pleasures, kept, herself in the back 
ground with a look of disgust; while Lucie and Jeanne, 
in spite of their trembling, kept an eye held to a crack 
so as not to lose anything that was going on. The 



2bU GERMINAL. 

thundering roll drew nearer; the ground shook, and 
Jeanlin was the first to appear, blowing his horn. 

'' Take your smelling bottles, the riff-raff of the peo- 
ple are passing," said Megrel, whose republican pro- 
clivities induced him to jest with the ladies about the 
canaille. 

But his joke was lost like a straw in the whirlwind of 
gesticulations and cries. The women had appeared; 
nearly a thousand women, with streaming hair, dishev- 
eled by the race, in rags showing the bare skin, half- 
naked women tired of giving birth to children only to 
see them die of hunger. Some held their little ones in 
their arms; raised them; waved them about like a flag 
of mourning and vengeance. Others, younger, with the 
swollen throats of warriors, brandished sticks; while the 
old ones, frightful-looking, howled so loud that the 
cords of their scraggy necks seemed to be breaking. 
Then the men streamed along; two thousand furious 
men, errand-boys, miners, repairers, a compact mass 
rolling on in a single serried column, crowded together 
in such a manner that neither the faded breeches nor 
the old woolen jackets could be distinguished, all being 
uniform in the blackness of dirt. Their eyes were 
burning, the openings only of their dark mouths were 
seen, singing the Marseillaise, the verses being lost in a 
confused roar, accompanied by the clattering of their 
sabots on the hard ground. Over the heads of the 
people was carried on high an axe, as the standard of 
the people, and in the clear heavens the sharp blade 
shone out like a guillotine. 

"What atrocious faces!" said Madame Hennebeau 
with a shudder. 

Megrel forced himself to laugh again; but even he 
was growing frightened. He muttered between his 
closed teeth: 

" The devil take me if I know one of them. Where 
do these ruffians come from?" 

And in reality, rage, hunger, these months of suffer- 
ing and the mad tramps around the mines, had extended 
their jaws like beasts, entirely changing the once placid 
faces of the coal men of Montson. The sun was set- 
ting; the last rays of a sombre red illumined the plain. 
The road seemed filled with blood and the women and 



GEEMINAL. 281 

men continued to pass, dyed like butchers in the 
midst of slaughter, 

"■ Oh! it is superb!" said Lucie and Jeanne in a low 
voice, their artists' taste aroused by that horrible splen- 
dor. 

Still, they trembled; they stepped back near Mme. 
Hennebeau, who had become so weak that she laid down 
upon a trough. The thought that only a look through 
the cracked door would be enough for them all to be 
slaughtered, made her shiver. Megrel felt himself 
growing pule; though ordinarily courageous, he Vv^as now 
seized with a fright superior to his will. Cécile, still in 
the hay, never moved. And the others, in spite of their 
desire to turn away their eyes, could not do so and still 
kept on looking. 

It was the red morn of a revolution which will carry 
all before it in a bloody night before the end of the 
century. Yes, one evening the people let loose, un- 
bridled, will run thus on the roads and spill the blood 
of the citizens; they will carry their heads on poles and 
scatter the gold from their safes. The women will 
shriek; the men will have their wolf-like jaws open to 
bite. Yes, there would be the same rags, the same 
thunder of heavy shoes, the same terrible crowd of 
dirty skins and infected breaths, killing the old people 
in their savage pushing. Houses would be burned; not 
a wall of the cities would remain; the}^ would return to 
to the wild life of the woods after great feasting; when 
the poor in the night would beat down the women and 
empty the cellars of the rich. There would be nothing 
left — not a cent — of the great fortunes; it would be like 
a new land. Yes, it was these things which passed on 
the roa^d like a force of nature, and they received the 
terrible truth in their faces. 

A great cry was heard above the Marseillaise: 

*' Bread! bread! bread!" 

Megrel was still pale. Lucie and Jeanne pressed 
closer to Mme. Hennebeau whose limbs were growing 
weak. "Was it that evening even that the old society 
trembled ? What they next saw stupefied them. The 
mob passed on until none were left, but the last few 
ranks, when Moquette appeared. She was lost; she 
watched for the rich people behind the gates of their 



282 GEEMINAL. 

gardens, at the windows of their houses ; and when she 
discovered them, not being able to spit in their faces, 
she did whatever she could to express her contempt. 

The crowd went off towards Montson, and when the 
carriage was brought out the coachman did not wish to 
take upon himself the risk to drive back Mme. Henne- 
beau and the young ladies, for fear the strikers still 
held possession of the roads. 

" We must return, for dinner will be waiting for us," 
said Mme. Heunebeau, out of temper with herself, ex- 
asperated at her fright. Those dirty workmen might 
have chosen some other day than the one on which she 
had guests for dinner. 

Lucie and Jeanne were busy pulling Cécile from the 
hay. She did not wish to come out, as she thought the 
savages were still passing. At length they all took their 
places in the carriage. Megrel jumped on his horse and 
he thought to pass by the lane to Eequillart. 

" Go slowly," said he to the coachman, "the road is 
in a terrible condition. If there is any one near the 
house you can stop by the old mine and we can go 
through the little door of the garden, while you can put 
up the horses and carriage at an inn," 

They started, the mob at a distance were now coming 
from Montson. Everyone was becoming frightened at 
them, and the notary was especially alarmed, for he had 
received an anonymous letter informing him that a bar- 
rel of powder was buried in his cellar, all ready to blow 
him up, if he did not declare himself in favor of the 
people. 

When the Gregoires came to the house to pay a call, 
this letter was discussed and laughed over, and when 
the mob invaded the house, they peeped from the cur- 
tains refusing to admit that they feared any danger; it 
would all end peaceably, they said. Five o'clock struck; 
but they were compelled to wait until the road was clear 
before going to meet Cécile at Hennebeau's. In Mont- 
son no one else seemed to feel so confident as thej; 
doors and windows were fastened; frightened people 
were running to and fro; and across the street Maigrat 
was closing up his store with heavy iron bars, so pale 
and so trembling that his little weak wife was obliged 
to fasten the bolts. 



GEKMIÎfAL. 383 

A cry rang out; the mob had stopped before the 
director's house. 

''Bread! bread! bread!" 

M. Hennebeau was standing at the window of his 
office, when Hypolite entered and closed the shutters, 
for fear the window panes would be broken by the 
stones. He shut all the windows of the ground floor; 
then passed to the first story above and one by one the 
shutters were heard flying together. Unhappily, the 
kitchen windows would not shut, and the fire and 
bright sauce-pans shone out upon the road. 

M. Hennebeau, who wished to see, ascended to the 
top of the house and entered Paul's room, and from 
behind the window blinds he watched the crowd. But 
he glanced round that room; it had all been put in 
order, and, as he looked, the anger of the morning grad- 
ually passed away. What good would it do to make a 
scandal? Nothing was changed with him; his wife had 
simply another lover; what difference did it make if 
she had chosen him from among her husband's rela- 
tives; it was only an affair calling for a little more con- 
tempt from him. A dreadful bitterness filled him that" 
he should still adore that wretched woman. 

Under the window the yells had burst out with in- 
creased violence. 

"Bread! bread! bread!" 

"Fools!" said M. Hennebeau, between his teeth. 

He heard them abusing him in reference to his large 
appointments. The women had perceived the kitchen 
and a storm of imprecations followed for the cook, who 
was among the greasy sauce pans. 

"Bread! bread! bread!" 

" Fools," repeated M. Hennebeau. " Am I happy?" 

A fierce anger was arising against those people who 
could not understand. He would have given them all 
he had to have been without regrets. Yes, his luxury, 
his education, his home, the directorship, all would 
have been willingly given up, if he could but enjoy the 
wedded life of the poorest of those miserable creatures. 

But the shouts still rang out: 

"Bread! bread! bread!" 

Then he became exasperated, he cried furiously in the 
noise: 



284 GERMINAL. 

''Bread! does that suffice fools?" 

His entire life arose before him. Because one had 
bread is no sign that he was happy. Who was the idiot 
that said wealth brought happiness? Those revolution- 
ist dreamers could demolish society and build another. 
They could not add to the joys of humanity, they could 
not take away from man a sorrow, by cutting off for 
each one his slice of bread. Even that would increase 
the unhappiness of the earth, and make the very dogs 
howl in despair. No, the only good thing was not to 
be; or if one did exist, then to be a tree, a stone, or 
better still, a grain of sand which cannot bleed under 
the heel of the passer by. 

And, in his anguish, tears filled his eyes and then 
rolled down his cheeks. Twilight was settling down on 
the road, when the stones began to rain against the 
front of the house. Without anger now against those 
furious people, enraged only by the sharp wound in his 
own heart, he continued to murmur, amid his tears: 

"The fools! the fools!" 

But the hungry cry still rang out, a tempestuous yell, 
•overpowering everything: 

"Bread! bread! bread!" 



CHAPTER XXIX. 



Etienne, whom Catherine's slap had sobered, ran on 
ahead of his comrades. But as he ordered them on 
toward Montson, another voice within him cried, *' Why 
all this?" How was it that, when he had started for 
Jean-Bart, intending to act calmly, and, if possible, 
prevent a disaster, he had finished the day with violence 
and by besieging the director's house? 

When the mob spoke of going to the yards of the 
company and destroying everything, he shouted, " Stop!" 
Now that the stones had already begun to deface the 
front of the house, he asked himself — without finding 
an answer — upon what legitimate prey he could set his 
men, in order to avoid greater misfortune. He was 
alone, powerless in the middle of the road, when some 
one called him. It was a workman standing on the 



GERMINAL. 285 

threshold of the saloon Tison, the proprietress of which 
had hastily fastened up the shutters, but left the door 
open. 

''Come in, we're all here." 

When he recognized Jouvarine, Etienne entered. 
Thirty men and women, most of them from the alley of 
tlie Deux-Cent-Quarante, who came to this saloon every 
night and morning to get the news of the strike, had 
taken refuge there at the approach of the mob. Zacharie 
occupied one table with his wife, Philomêne,. and his 
his friend Moquet. At another Pierron and his wife sat 
with their faces hid. No one was drinking, they simply 
came there to hide themselves. 

"This is senseless," said Jouvarine, as he lit a cigar- 
ette. "I knew you would wear yourself out without 
doing any good. . . . A little cask of powder thrown 
in that house would have done more good than all this 
noise." 

But Etienne was not listening to him. He had seen 
Easseneur standing against the counter, and, as he 
turned round at once to go back into the road, the latter 
said : 

" The sight of me annoys you, does it not? I told you 
annoyances would begin. 'Now, when you demand 
bread, they will give you lead." 

Then Etienne stepj)ed back towards him, answering: 

" What annoys me is the comrades who stand by with 
folded arms and watch us risking our lives. And I say 
this for you also, Jouvarine, for you annoy me, too, 
with your talk about destroying all when you would not 
hurt a fly." 

The engineer smiled tranquilly, showing his sharp 
little teeth. 

" Oh! your affairs are none of my business." 

" Your idea is to keep right on in this foolishness, 
then?" said Eassanuer. 

" My idea is to stick to my comrades, and, if need be, 
to die with them." 

And the young man went out again desperate, ready 
to die. 

In the road he met three children throwing stones. 
He gave them a hard kick, telling them to stop, it did 
no good to break windows. 



286 GERMINAL. 

It was Bebert and Lydie who had just met Jeanlin, 
who was learning to handle his sling with dexterity. 
They were all throwing stones and betting as to who 
could do the most damage. Lydie had just cut a 
woman's head, and the two boys roared with laughter, 
while Bonnemort and Moque were seated on a log 
watching them. The former had with difficulty dragged 
himself along all this distance on his swollen legs. 

They no longer paid any attention to Etienne. In 
spite of his order, the stones continued to fly; he was 
astonished and frightened before these brutes unmuz- 
zled by him, so slow to be moved, but at last terrible 
with a ferocious tenacity in their rage. All the old 
fiery blood was there, which, at first slow and quiet, it 
had taken months to excite, but, after it was stirred up 
they threw themselves into the most abominable ex- 
cesses, caring for nothing. He fought with Levaque 
trying to snatch his axe from him; he could not restrain 
the Maheus, who were throwing stones with both hands. 
The women especially frightened him, la Levaque, Mo- 
quette and the others, showing their teeth and nails; 
they howled like female dogs under the guidance of old 
Brule who had become their leader. 

But there was a sudden pause ; the surprise of a mo- 
ment caused a little suspension of hostilities, which 
Etienne with all his shouting could not obtain. The 
Gregoires had decided to take leave of the notary and 
start across the road to the director's house ; and tJiey 
seemed so peaceable, so smiling, they had so much the 
air of believing it all a joke on the part of their fierce 
miners, whose patience had nourished them for a 
century, that the mob, astonished, overwhelmed, ceased 
throwing their stones, for fear of hitting that old 
gentleman and lady, who, they believed, had fallen 
from the sky. They allowed them to enter the garden, 
ascend the door steps, and knock at the barricaded 
door, which the occupants within seemed in no haste to 
open. Just then the chambermaid. Rose, returning 
from her day out, smiled at the furious workmen, all. of 
whom she knew, as she was from Montson. And she. 
by pounding on the door with her fist, compelled 
Hypolite to open it half way. It was time, for the 
Gregoires had but just disappeared within, when the 



GERMINAL. 287 

shower of stones again commenced. Eecovering from 
its surprise the mob clamored still louder : 

" Death to the aristocracy; long live the socialists!" 

Eose continued to laugh, and standing in the hall 
she said to the cook: 

" They're not bad: I know them.-*^ 

M. Grégoire hung his hat on the rack and, when he 
had assisted his wife to take off her heavy cloth mantle, 
he said: 

"No doubt in their hearts there is no malice. When 
they have had enough of it they will go and endure 
once more." 

At this moment M. Henneheau came down from the 
top of the house. He had been watching the scene and 
he now came to receive his guests with his usual man- 
ner, cold and polite. The pallor of his face alone 
showed the tears that he had shed. The man was sunk 
out of sight; there now only remained the engineer, 
the correct administrator, determined to fulfill his duty. 

" The ladies have not returned yet," he said. 

For the first time the Gregoires felt uneasy. Cécile 
not there yet! How could she enter if the jokes of 
those miners should be prolonged ? 

"I have thought of having the house cleared," said 
M. Hennebeau. " But the worst of it is I am alone 
here and I do not know where to send the servant to 
bring me four men and a corporal, who would soon 
clear out this rabble." 

Rose, who had been forgotten, again murmured: 

"Oh! Monsieur, they are not bad." 

The director shook his head as the tumult increased 
outside and the stones were heard cracking against the 
house. 

"I have no grudge against them. I know very well 
how things have gone on; but if they were not so stupid 
they would see that we are excited by their unhappiness. 
But I wish to be quiet. Just think, they tell me the 
country is full of gendarmes, and yet, since morning, I 
have not been able to find one." 

He interrupted himself, and, standing before Madame 
Grégoire, said, with rather stiff politeness: 

" I pray you, Madame, do not remain here. Go into 



288 GERMIÎs^AL. 

the salon, where, though it is not yet night, we shall 
be obliged to light the lamps." 

But the cook was in despair ; he was waiting for a 
pastry cook from Marchiennes, who was to make the 
Tol-au-vent and all the dessert; he would not be re- 
ponsible for the dinner if he had to make them himself. 
Perhaps the baskets had been stolen by those people. 
At any rate, he would rather throw his dinner in the fire 
than have it a failure on account of this riot. 

"Have a little patience,"' said M. Hennebeau; "no- 
thing is lost yet; the pastry cook may come.-*' 

As he turned toward Madame Grégoire, holding open 
the door of the salon, he was surprised to see sitting on 
a bench in the hall, a man whom he had not dis- 
tinguished until then, on account of the increased dark- 
ness. He recognized him, and cried: 

" Why, it's you, Maigrat. What is the matter? '* 

Maigrat arose, and his face appeared still fatter, but 
very pale from fright. He had slipped into the direct- 
or's house, to claim help and protection, if they should 
attack his store. 

" You see that I am also threatened, and I have no 
one," answered M. Hennebeau. "You would have 
done better to have remained at home to protect your 
goods." 

" But I have put up the iron bars and left mv wife 
there." 

The director grew impatient, without trying to con- 
ceal his contempt. That delicate creature was a fine 
guard. 

" I advise you to return home at once, and try to de- 
fend yourself, for they are again crying for bread. 
Listen." 

The cries had began again and Maigrat thought he 
heard his name. Then he became almost wild. It was 
no longer possible to return; they would cut him in 
pieces. But, on the other hand, the thought of his 
ruin troubled him. He remained with his face pressed 
close to the glass pane of the door, perspiring, tremb- 
ling, watching the riot; but the Gregoires decided to go 
into the salon. 

Quietly, M. Hennebeau tried to do the honors. But 
he vainly begged his guests to be seated; the closed and 



GERMINAL. 28Ô 

barricaded room, lit by two lamps although it was yet 
day, seemed filled with fear at each new clamor outside. 
T^hey talked of nothing but the riot. The director was 
astonished at not having been warned; but then, the 
police force was so badly kept up; he was especially an- 
gered at Easseneur, whose evil influence he said he 
recognized. However, the gendarmes Avere sure to 
come, it was impossible that they would abandon them 
in this manner. As for the Gregoires, .they only 
thought of their daughter, the poor darling was so 
easily frightened! perhaps before this, on account of 
the danger, the carriage had returned to Marchiennes. 
They waited another quarter of an hour, unnerved by 
the noise from the road and by the stones beating from 
time to time on the closed shutters, sounding like 
drums. The situation was becoming intolerable; M. 
Hennebeau was speaking of going out and chasing the 
brawlers away himself, and then going to meet the car- 
riage, when Hypolite ran into the salon, crying: 

"Monsieur! monsieur! here is madame; they are 
killing madame." 

As Megrel feared, the carriage had not been able to 
pass through the narrow road of Kequillart in the 
midst of those threatening crowds. Then he thought 
they could walk the hundred metres which separated 
them from the house and enter by the little gate open- 
ing into the garden, which was near the servants' 
quarters; the gardener would hear them and open the 
gate. At first the plan had worked splendidly, Madame 
Hennebeau and the young ladies were already at the 
little gate, when the women, informed by a boy, had 
thrown themselves in the narrow passage. Then all 
was spoiled. The gate would not open. Vainly Megrel 
tried to force it in with his shoulders. Then pushing 
before him his aunt and the young ladies he tried to run 
and reach the steps. But this attempt only angered 
the crowd more. They would not allow them to go. 
A howling mob followed them, some astonished at those 
beautifully-dressed ladies who had fallen among them. 
From that moment the confusion became such that it 
brought about one of those incidents which are always 
inexplainable. Lucie and Jeanne first arrived at the 
step and ran in the door, which had been partially 



390 GERMIXA.L. 

opened by the chambermaid. Madame Hennebeau suc- 
ceeded in following them, and then Megrel entered and 
bolted the door, satisfied that Cécile had been the first 
to pass in. But she was not there. Carried away by 
her fright she must have run from the house and rushed 
right into the mob. 

Suddenly the cry arose: 

** Long live the socialists! Death to the aristocrats! 
Death to them!" 

Some one in the distance, under the veil which hid 
her face, took her for Madame Hennebeau. Others 
said she was a friend of the Madame's, the young wife 
of a neighboring owner, hated by his workmen. But 
more than all, it was her silk dress, her fur cloak, and 
the white feather in her hat, which exasperated them. 
She had a watch, and the pure skin of an idle person 
who did not touch the coal. 

" Let's tear her clothes off ! " cried la Levaque. 

Then Moquette rushed up. 

*' Yes, yes, we must beat her." 

And the women were suffocated with their savage 
jealousy, each one wishing some piece of the clothing 
worn by that rich girl. This injustice had lasted long 
enough; they would force them to dress like workmen, 
these wretches who dared spend twenty-five cents for 
the washing of a skirt. 

Amid these furies Cécile shivered; her limbs trem- 
bled, and she unceasingly stammered the same sentence: 

"Mesdames, I beg of you; mesdames, do not hurt 
me." 

But a hoarse shriek broke from her lips; cold hands 
took her by the throat. It was old Bonnemort, who held 
her. He was ignorant whether he wished to save or 
strangle her. He seemed drunk by hunger, stupefied 
by his long misery, suddenly coming out from his pa- 
tience of a half century, without being able to 
understand what had called forth his hatred. After 
having saved in his lifetime a dozen of his comrades 
from death, risking his own life in the fire-damp and 
cavings, he now gave himself up to an impulse, for 
which he would not have been able to account, a wish 
to do this deed, a fascination for the white throat of 
that young girl. Although that day he had been silent. 



GERMIÎfAL. 291 

he wrung his hands with the air of an old infirm beast, 
recalling some recollection. 

In the house, as soon as they perceived the absence 
of Cécile, Megrel and M, Hennebeau again opened the 
door to run out and save her. The mob now threw 
themselves against the railing around the garden, and it 
was not easy to get out. A struggle was about to com- 
mence, when the frightened Gregoires appeared on the 
door-step. 

** Leave her alone, old man! it's the daughter of 
the Piolaine people,'' cried la Maheu to the grand- 
father, as she recognized the young girl whose veil a 
woman had snatched off. 

Etienne, ashamed of retaliations taken against a child, 
and wishing to make the crowd let her alone, with a 
sudden inspiration brandished the axe, crying : 

" To Maigrat's. He has bread there. Let's break 
down Maigrat's shop." 

He ran and gave a first blow to the shutters of the 
shop. Some comrades had followed him, Maheu, 
Levaque and others. But the women were excited. 
Cécile had fallen from the hands of Bonnemort into 
those of old Brule ; while Jeanlin, Bebert and Lydie 
were pulling at her clothes, tearing them in peices. 
Suddenly a man on horseback appeared, whipping aside 
those who did not move quickly enough. 

" You beasts, what are you about ?" 

It was Deneulin, who was coming hastily to the din- 
ner. He quickly jumped into the road, took Cécile by 
the waist with one hand and with the other led the 
horse, making him kick and jump from side to side to 
clear a path for them. At the railing of the garden the 
battle continued. However he passed through, though 
bruising their limbs some. This unforseen assistance 
delivered Megrel and M. Hennebeau, who were in great 
danger, in the midst of the oaths and blows. And, 
while the young engineer returned into the house with 
Cécile who had fainted, Deneulin, who covered the 
director with his large body, at the top of the door- 
step, received such a hard blow with a stone that his 
shoulder was disjointed. 

" They have broken up my machinery, and now they 
break my bones," said he. 



292 GERMINAL. 

He pushed open the door, on which a shower of peb- 
bles struck. 

"How desperate they are!" said he again. "Two 
seconds more and they would have burst my skull. 
One can say nothing to them. Tliey do not know any 
more what they want. The only thing left to do is to 
beat them to death." 

In the salon, the Gregoires were crying, though Cécile 
had regained consciousness. She was not injured, not 
even scratched; only her veil was lost. But their fright 
increased when they saw before them their cook Melanie, 
who told them the mob wanted to demolish Piolaine. 
Filled with fear, she had run to inform her masters. 
She had entered by the half-open door during the 
wrangle, without any one noticing her; and, in her 
exaggerated story, the one stone thrown by Jeanlin, 
which had broken a single pane of glass, became a reg- 
ular cannonade by which the very walls were split open. 
Then the opinions of M. Grégoire were changed about. 
They strangled his daughter; they broke down his 
house. It must be true, then, that those miners had a 
grudge against him, because he lived, as an honorable 
man, by their labor. 

The chamber-maid, who had brought a towel and 
some cologne water, repeated a third time. 

"It's strange, all the same they're not bad." 

Madame Hennebeau, who had seated herself, was very 
pale, not having yet recovered from her shock; and she 
only smiled when they congratulated Megrel. It seemed 
it was not Deneulin, who had saved Cécile. The par- 
ents especially thanked the young man; the marriage 
now appeared to be settled. M. Hennebeau looked on 
in silence; from his wife to her lover whom he had 
wished to kill that morning; and then to the young 
girl, who would no doubt be very soon gotten rid of. 
He folt no hatred now; a single fear remained to him, 
that of seeing his wife fall lower, to some footman 
perhaps. 

"And you, my little darlings," said Deneulin to his 
daughters, "they have not hurt you, have they?" 

Lucie and Jeanne had been very much frightened, 
but they were glad to have seen it. They were laugh- 
ing now. 



GERMIÎfAL. 293 

*' Sapristi!" continued the father, "this has been a 
nice day. ... If you want a dowery, you will have 
to earn it yourselves, and you may yet be forced to feed 
me." 

He joked in a trembling voice. His eyes filled when 
his two girls threw themselves into his arms. 

M. Hennebeau had heard that acknowledgment of 
ruin. His face lighted up. Vandame would yet belong 
to Montson; it was the compensation waited for, the 
stroke of fortune which would restore him in the favor 
of the owners. In every disaster of his life he had taken 
refuge in the strict execution of orders received ; he 
maintained military discipline where he lived, which was 
his idea of happiness. But they calmed down. The 
salon fell into a weary quiet with the tranquil light of 
the two lamps and the warmth of the hangings. What 
was going on now outside? The fools were silent, stones 
no longer beat against the front of the house, and they 
only heard dull, heavy blows, the blows of an axe striking 
on wood, in the distance. They wished to know what it 
was, and returned to the hall and risked a glance 
through the broken glass. Even the women went up to 
peep from the windows on the second story. 

" Do you see that rascal, Rasseneur, in front of us 
upon the doorstep of the shop?" said M. Hennebeau to 
Deneulin. *' I knew he was there, he is always one of 
the first." 

Nevertheless, it was not Easseneur, it was Etienne 
who was breaking in Maigrat's shop with an axe. And 
he kept calling his comrades; did not the goods in there 
belong to the coalmen? Was it not just to make this 
robber disgorge — this wretch who had traded on them 
so long, who starved them at the slightest word from 
the company? 

Gradually all abandoned the house of the director 
and ran to jiillage the neighboring shop. The cry: 
** bread ! bread ! bread ! " was shouted again. They would 
find bread behind that door. A rage for bread had 
seized them again, as if, all at once, they could wait no 
longer without dying on the road. They rushed against 
the shutters in such a manner that Etienne was in fear 
of wounding his comrades at each blow of the axe. 

Meanwhile, Maigrat, who had left the vestibule of the 



294 GERMINAL. 

house at the time of the scuffle, liad taken refuge first 
in the kitchen below; but he heard nothing there; he 
imagined his shop would be attacked, and he had just 
re-ascended to hide behind the pump outside, when he 
clearly heard the crashing of his door, and the shouts of 
the rioters, in which his name mingled. It was not the 
nightmare then; he did not see, but he heard now; he 
followed the attack with eager ears. Every blow of the 
axe struck full on his heart. A bolt must have given 
way; two minutes more and the shop would be taken. 
All this was depicted in his brain in frightful reality; 
the brigands sacking the house, drawers broken open, 
bags emptied, everything eaten, everything drank, the 
house itself carried off, nothing left, not even a stick to 
go and beg with through the villages. . No, he would 
not let himself be ruined in that manner; lie would 
rather give them his life. Since he had been there, he 
perceived at a window of his house, the thin profile of 
his wife, pale and troubled, behind the panes; doubtless 
she was watching the blows with her dumb look, like 
that of a poor beaten creature. Below there was a sta- 
ble, placed in such a manner that, from the garden of 
the house, it could be reached by clutching the trellis- 
work of the partition wall: after that it would be easy 
to creep along the tiles as far as the window. And the 
idea of thus getting into his house again tortured him 
now, in his remorse for having left it. Perhaps he 
could have barricaded the door with furniture; he even 
invented other modes of heroic defense — boiling oil, 
lighted petroleum poured out from above. 

But this affection for his goods struggled furiously 
against his fear; he recoiled from the fight with coward- 
ice. All at once a louder blow from the axe decided 
him. Avarice carried the day; he and his wife would 
cover the sacks with their bodies sooner than yield a 
loaf of bread. 

Shouts broke out at once: 

"Look! Look! . . . The monkey's there! Go 
for him!" 

The mob had just perceived Maigrat upon the roof of 
the shed. Though a heavy man he had climbed the 
fence with alacrity, without caring for the breaking 
wood; and now he had flattened himself out along the 



GERMINAL. 295 

tiles, trying to reach the window. But the slope was 
very steep and his nails were torn away. Nevertheless 
he would have dragged himself up to the top, if he had 
not begun to tremble with a fear of being stoned; for 
the crowd beneath him still continued to cry: 

" Go for himl We'll cut him to pieces! " 

Suddenly, losing his hold, he rolled like a ball and 
fell upon the wall, and from there dropped over on one 
side of the road, with his skull fractured. His brains 
gushed out; he was dead. His wife, up-stairs, pale 
and trembling behind the window panes, had seen the 
whole occurrence. 

At first a stupor came upon them. Etienne paused 
with the axe still in his hand. Mahue, Levaque and 
the others, forgetting the shop, turned their eyes to- 
ward the wall from which slowly ran a small red stream. 
The cries ceased; a shivering silence came in the grow- 
ing shadows. 

But suddenly the cries again commenced. It was 
the women alone this time. 

"It served him right!" 

They surrounded the still warm dead body; they 
lauglied at him, spitting in the face of the dead the 
hatred of their long life without bread. 

"I owed you sixty francs; there you are paid, thief!" 
said la Mahue. "You'll not refuse my credit any 
more. Wait till I fatten you more!" 

With her ten fingers she tore up the earth, and tak- 
ing her two hands full she stuffed it in the dead man's 
mouth. 

"Eat, now! eat! you who were eating us!" 

The insults increased; they all seemed wild; while 
the dead man, lying on his back, steadily stared with 
his large open eyes up into the immense sky from which 
night was falling. That earth stuffed in his mouth was 
the bread he had refused them, and that was the only 
bread he would eat now; it had not brought him happi- 
ness to starve the poor people. Up at the window, the 
Avidow Maigrat never moved; but under the last light 
of the setting sun, the imperfections in the window 
glass spotted her pale face which seemed to smile. 
Beaten every hour, her shoulders bent from morning 



29G GERMINAL. 

until night over the register, perhaps she was happy 
at the thought of her ended sufferings. 

In frozen horror, Etienne and Mahue had looked on, 
without interfering. Then, as the women ran oS, they 
stood motionless, looking after those furies. At the 
door of Tison's saloon, heads were thrust out. Ras- 
seneur pale with rage, Jouvarine with eyes shining like 
candles, and Zachaire, Moquet and Philomene, stupefied 
by the horrible spectacle they had seen. The two old 
men, Bonnemort and Moque, seriously shook their heads. 
Jeanlin alone laughed. 

Etienne again flourished the axe. But the horror 
could not be cast oiï ; that dead body lay across the 
road, protecting the shop ; many moved away. It 
seemed a recompense, which quieted them all. Maheu 
remained quiet, but a voice said in his ear, "Run away." 
He turned and recognized Catherine, still in her man's 
coat, dirty and out of breath. With a gesture, he 
pushed her away. He did not wish to listen to her, and 
threatened to beat her. Then she was in despair and, 
after hesitating a little, ran to Etienne : 

"Run away! run away! here are the gendarmes." 

He also drove her away, abusing her, as he felt the 
blood rush to his cheek from the slap she had given him. 
But she was not discouraged. She made him throw 
down the axe. She pulled him away with both arms 
with an irresistible strength. 

" Won't you listen to me, when I tell you the gen- 
darmes are coming? It's Cheval, who has gone to get 
them, if you want to know. It disgusted me, so I 
came to warn you. Save yourself. I don't want them 
to take you." 

At that instant the heavy sound of horses' feet was 
heard and the cry burst forth: " The gendarmes! the 
gendarmes!" They ran off so quickly that in two min- 
utes the road was free, absolutely clear, as if swept by 
a storm. The corpse of Maigrat made the only dark 
spot upon the white earth. At the door of the Tison 
saloon there only remained Rasseneur, who applauded 
the arrival of the gendarmes; while in deserted Mont- 
son the rich people remained behind closed shutters, 
covered with a cold perspiration, and their teeth chatter- 
ing. The plain spread out under the dark night, there 



GERMINAL. 297 

were only the high furnaces and coke fires burning in 
the dark sky. The heavy galop of the gendarmes was 
coming nearer; they rushed on without being distin- 
guishable, in a durk mass. And behind them in their 
care, the carriage of the pastry cook of Marchiennes at 
last arrived; a cart from which jumped a cook boy, who, 
with a quiet air began to unpack the dessert^ the pastry, 
and the vol-au-vent. 



CHAPTER XXX. 



Another fortnight passed. The first days of February 
had arrived, yvith the black frosts which prolonged the 
hard winter pitiless to the poor. Officials had again 
searched the country, the Prefect of Lille, a Procurator, 
and a General. And the gendarmes had not sufficed; 
some of the troops had come to occupy Montson — a regi- 
ment. The men encamped from Beaugines to Mar- 
chiennes. At all the trenches sentinels guarded the 
wells; armed soldiers were before each engine; the 
director's house, the company's yards, even the houses 
of certain well-to-do men were bristling with bayonets. 
Nothing else was heard on the long pavement but the 
slow step of the patrol. On the stump of Voreux a 
sentinel stood immovable like a look-out above the 
barren plain in the icy wind which whistled above, and 
every two hours, as in an enemy's country, re-echoed the 
challenge of the guard. 

"Who goes there? Advance, and give the counter- 
sign." 

But under this military despotism, in the terror which 
pervaded the country, labor had nowhere recommenced. 
On the contrary, the strike had extended. Crevecoeur, 
Miron, la Madeleine stopped the roll-call, like the Voreux, 
Victoire, and Feutry-Cantel lost their people every 
morning. At St. Thomas, even men were missing. It 
was now a dumb obstinacy contending with this display 
of force, which exasperated the pride of the miners. 
The alleys seemed deserts in the midst of the best fields. 
Xot a workman stirred, hardly could even one be met 
with, solitary, with dark and sullen look and lowered 



298 GERMINAL. 

head before the red-trousered soldiers. And under this 
mournful silence, this passive stubbornness beating 
against the guns there was a false calm. The forced and 
patient obedience of caged beasts with eyes tixed on 
their keeper ready to devour him the instant he turned 
his back. The company which this stagnation of work 
was ruining spoke of hiring the miners of the Borinage, 
on the Belgian frontier, but they did not dare, and so 
the battle rested there between the coalmen in revolt 
and the silent pits guarded by the soldiers. 

A calm suddenly fell, on the next day after the riot, 
hidiug such a panic, that the damages and atrocities of 
that terrible day had been kept as secret as possible. 
The inquest decided that Maigrat died from his fall, 
and the frightful mutilation of the corpse remained a 
mystery, surrounded by a rumor. There had been no 
pillage of the store. On the other side, the company 
did not acknowledge having sustained any damages, any 
more than the Gregoires, who did not care to com- 
promise their daughter through the scandal of a law 
suit, where she would have to give evidence. Notwith- 
standing some arrests had been made of men who were 
astounded, witless, and knew nothing. By mistake 
Pierron had been taken handcuffed as far as Mar- 
chiennes, and the co'untry still laughed at it. Easseneur 
also just escaped being dragged off between two gen- 
darmes. The director contented himself with sending 
in discharges to the principals. Maheu had received 
his, Levaque also, and thirty-four of their comrades 
had been treated likewise. But all the blame fell upon 
Etienne, who had been missing since the evening of the 
fight, and sought for everywhere in vain. Cheval, in 
his hatred, denounced him, and only refused to name 
the others at the entreaty of Catherine, who wished at 
least to save her parents. The days passed; it M^as felt 
that all was not over; the end was awaited in the midst 
of intolerable anguish, stifling every breast during this 
ominous and deceitful calm. At Montson the peasants 
awoke at night with a start at the sound of an imagin- 
ary alarm bell, and the strong, familiar smell of i»ovvder. 
But that which astonished them most was a sermon' 
from the new Cure, the Abbe Eanvier, the lank priest 
with red- looking eyes, who had succeeded the Abbe 



GERMIKAL. 299 

Joire. How far removed was he from the smiling pru- 
dence of the latter, the sole aim of the good fat man 
being to live in peace with all the world! Had not the 
Abbe Ranvier undertaken the defence of the abomin- 
able robbers about to dishonor the district? He found 
excuses for the rascalities of the strikers, he violently 
denounced the peasantry on whom he laid all the 
blame. 

It was the peasantry who, dispossessing the church 
of her ancient liberties to misuse them themselves, had 
made this world an accursed abode of injustice and 
suffering; it was they who prolonged misunderstand- 
ings, who brought on a frightful catastrophe by their 
atheism, by their refusal to return to the faith and the 
brotherly traditions of the early Christians. And he 
had dared to threaten the rich; he had warned them 
that if they still refused to hear the voice of God, He 
would surely take the side of the poor; He would take 
their fortunes from these sceptics; He would distribute 
them among earth's lowly ones, for the triumph of His 
glory, for the glory of His name. The devout trembled 
at it; the notary declared that it contained pure social- 
ism; all seemed to see the Curé at the head of a mob, 
brandishing a cross, demolishing, with heavy blows, the 
peasantry of eighty-nine. 

M. Hennebeau, when informed, with a shrug of his 
shoulders, said: "If he worries us too much, the bishop 
will rid us of him." 

While the panic thus spread from one end of the 
plain to the other, Etienne lived underground at the 
bottom of Requillart, Jeanlin's cave. There he hid 
himself; no one thought him so near; the calm audacity 
of this retreat into the mine itself, into this deserted 
gallery of an old shaft, saved him from pursuit. 

Above, the acacia and hawthorn trees, growing 
through the broken framework of the tower, concealed 
the opening; no risk was incurred, for the initiated 
could only enter by hanging to the roots of the mount- 
ain-ash, dropping fearlessly to the few rungs remaining 
in the second ladder; and other obstacles added to his 
security — the suffocating heat of the old shaft; a hun- 
dred and twenty metres of a dangerous descent; then 
the painful groping on one's stomach for a quarter of a 



300 GERMINAL. 

league between the narrow walls of the gallery before 
arriving at the villainous cavern filled with plunder. 

He lived there in the midst of plenty; he had found 
gin there, the remainder of the dried codfish and pro- 
visions of all kinds. The large bed of hay was excellent; 
not a draught of air was felt in this equable and 
pleasant atmosphere. Want of light only was threatened. 
The boy, who had constituted himself his caterer, with 
the prudence and cunning of a savage, delighted to out- 
wit the gendarmes, brought him even pomatum, but 
could not manage to get hold of a package of candles. 
After the fifth day Etienne only used a light at his 
meals. The candle ends would not last if used at night. 
This interminable night, with its unvarying blackness, 
was his great trial. Notwithstanding that he slept in 
safety, had bread and comfortable shelter, never had 
night weighed so heavily on his brain. It seemed as if 
thought itself were crushed. Now he was living on the 
spoils of robbers. In spite of his communistic theories, 
the old scruples of early education arose. He contented 
himself with dry bread and gnawed his bone. But 
what was to be done? He must live, for his task was 
not yet done. Another trouble oppressed him, remorse 
for his savage drunkenness from gin imbibed during the 
severe cold on an empty stomach, causing him to 
attack Cheval armed with a knife. This affected him 
with a nameless terror, the hereditary malady, the long 
inheritance of drunkenness, aggravated to such a point 
that a single drop of alcohol roused to homicidal fury. 
Would he then end by becoming an assassin? Eeaction 
took place, and a revolt against his socialistic theories 
followed. When he found himself in shelter, in this 
hole, in the profound silence of the earth, he was weary 
of violence; he had slept for two days like a beast filled 
and gorged. The softening of his heart went on; he felt 
bruised in spirit, with a bitter mouth and aching as if at 
the end of some terrible carousal. A week passed. The 
Maheus, warned, could not send a candle; he must give 
up the luxury of a light, even when eating. For hours 
together Etienne now remained stretched on his hay. 
Vague ideas, unknown hitherto, traversed his brain. A 
feeling of superiority arose, setting him apart from his 



GERMINAL. 301 

comrades; an exaltation of himself individually, in pro- 
portion as he became instructed and refined. 

Never had he reflected so much; he asked himself 
whence came his disgust the day after the furious race 
around the mines, and he dare not answer — recollection 
disgusted him, the base envyings, the vulgar instincts, 
the scent of all this Avretchedness borne on the wind! 
lu spite of the torturing darkness, he began to dread 
the hour of his return to the alley. The thought of 
those wretched creatures bundled in a heap, living in a 
trough, nauseated him! Not one with whom he could 
seriously talk on politics, a bestial existence — the stifling 
air always poisoned with onions. He wished to enlarge 
their heaven, to elevate them to the well-being and good 
habits of the peasantry, by making them the masters; 
but, how long it would be! and he no longer felt cour- 
ageous enougli to wait for victory in this gallery of 
hunger. Slowly, his vanity at being their leader, the 
constant pre-occupation of thinking for them, had in- 
fected him with the spirit of one of these peasants whom 
he execrated. One evening Jeanlin brought a bit of 
candle stolen from the lantern of a wagoner, and it was 
a great comfort to Etienne. When the darkness stupe- 
fied him and drove him mad, he lighted it for an in- 
stant; then, recovering himself, he would blow it out, 
husbanding the light, as necessary to his life as bread. 
The silence tinkled in his ears, he heard nothing but 
the scampering of a lot of rats, the crackling of the old 
timbering, the slight noise of a spider weaving his web. 
With open eyes in this vapid nothingness, he returned 
to this fixed idea: what his comrades were doing above 
and what they expected of him. Disertion on his part 
would have appeared to him the extreme of baseness. 
If he thus concealed himself, it was to remain free, to 
counsel and to act. His long dreams had brought his 
ambition to a focus; while awaiting better times, he 
would wish to be Pluchart, give up labor, occupied with 
politics only; but alone, in a clean room, under the 
pretext that mental labor absorbed existence entirely 
and required silence around. 

At the end of the week, the child having told him that 
the gendarmes believed him to be in Belgium, Etienne 
risked himself out of his hole as soon as night had 



302 GERMIKAL. 

fallen. He wished to judge of the position of affairs, 
and see if it were expedient to prolong the contest. 
His party was compromised. Before the strike, he had 
felt doubtful of the result; he had simply yielded to 
circumstances. And now, after steeping himself in the 
revolt, his former doubts returned, and he despaired of 
compelling the company to surrender. But he did not 
yet own it to himself. Uneasiness oppressed him when 
he thought of all the misery which defeat would entail: 
of the heavy responsibility of suffering which would 
rest upon him. Would not the end of the strike be the 
end of his career, of his earthly ambition, and his life 
return again to the brutality of the mine and alley? 
And honestly, without deceit, he endeavored to regain 
his faith; to prove to himself that resistance was still 
possible; that capital would destroy itself, opposed by 
the heroic suicide of labor. 

In fact, the whole country re-echoed with ruin. At 
night, when he wandered through the black roads, like 
a wolf from his lair, he seemed to hear the crashing of 
bankruptcy from one end of the plain to the other. As 
he went along the deserted roads, he saw only closed, 
dead works — the timbers rotting under the pale sky. 
The sugaries especially had suffered. The Fauville 
sugary, after having reduced the hands like the Hoton, 
succumbed in its turn. At the Dutilleul mill, the last 
stone had stopped on New Year's day; and the Blenze 
rope- walk for the cables of the mines was ruined by this 
hopeless standstill. 

On the Marchiennes side, disasters multiplied; at the 
Gagebois glass works all the fires were extinguished; 
continual dismissals at the Sonneville workshops; not 
one of the three blast-furnaces of Forges lighted; not 
one battery of the coke furnaces burning on the hori- 
zon. The strike of the coalheavers of Montson, spring- 
ing from the industrial crisis begun two years back, had 
extended and precipitated the out-break. To these 
causes of suffering — the suspension of orders from 
America, the sinking of capital in over production, 
were now added the unexpected want of coal for the 
few boilers still in use; and this was the climax of 
wretchedness, this failure of the moving power which 
the pits no longer supplied. In view of the general 



GERMIN"AL. 303 

distress, the company had feared to increase their 
stock, diminishing their product, starving their miners; 
thus at the end of December they found themselves 
without a bit of coal on the floor of their pits. The 
scourge traveled far and near — one fall brought down 
another, manufactories crushing each other as they 
tumbled down in such a series of rapid catastrophes, 
that the rebound reverberated throughout the neigh- 
boring cities, Lille, Douai, Valenciennes, where famil- 
ies were ruined by absconding bankers. Often, at the 
turn of a road, Etienne stopped, in the icy night, to 
listen to the falling rubbish. The darkness animated 
him, and a hope arose that a day would dawn on an ex- 
terminated old world, the leveling scythe of equality 
having passed over the earth. But the mines of the 
company especially interested him in this dissolution. 

He resumed his walks in the darkness, visiting one 
after another, happy with each fresh discovery of dam- 
age done. The fallings-in continued to take place, and 
the forced abandonment of the roads aggravated the 
disaster. Above the north gallery of Miron the sinking 
of the ground increased at such a rate that the road to 
Joiselle for a distance of one hundred metres was en- 
gulfed as by the shock of an earthquake, and the com- 
pany, uneasy at the rumors to which these accidents 
gave rise, reimbursed the proprietors of the abandoned 
fields, without any discussion. Crevecœur and la Made- 
leine, composed of crumbling stone, were more and more 
blocked up. Eumor spoke of two overseers swallowed 
up at Feutry-Cantel; a flood of water had inundated 
La Victoire; a kilometre of the gallery of St. Thomas 
had required a wall, the woodwork breaking on all sides. 
It was thus from hour to hour, enormous expenses, 
open gaps in the dividends of stockholders, a rapid de- 
struction of the pits which must terminate at last by 
eating up the famous stock of Montson, multiplied a 
hundredfold in a century. Thus from these repeated 
blows Etienne's hopes revived; he deceived himself, in- 
ducing the belief that a third month of resistance 
would finish the satiated and weary monster, cowering 
over there like an idol in the recesses of its tabernacle. 
He knew that the disturbances at Montson had excited 
much attention in the Parisian journals, a vigorous 



304 aEïiMiîTAL, 

warfare being carried on between the official organs and 
the opposition press, terrifying recitals, aimed especially 
at the International, of which the empire after having 
encouraged it was becoming afraid; and the adminis- 
tration being no longer able to turn a deaf ear in the 
midst of this tumult, two of the managers had at last 
condescended to come and make an investigation, but 
with an air of reluctance, without appearing to trouble 
themselves about the issue, and so disinterested that in 
three days they had already returned, pretending to 
say that everything was going on well. Notwithstand- 
ing, it was said elsewhere that these gentlemen during 
their stay held protracted sittings, displaying a feverish 
activity, deeply engaged in matters of which none 
around them breathed a word. And he accused them 
of breaking faith, and looking upon their departure as 
a despairing flight; he felt certain of victory since these 
terrible men abandoned all. 

But the next day Etienne again despaired. The 
company held the reins too firmly to have them broken 
so easily; even if they lost millions, they would regain 
them later on by stinting the laborers' bread. 

One night, having reached Jean-Bart, he surmised 
the truth when an overseer told him that they spoke of 
giving up Vandame to Montson. At Deneulin's the 
wretchedness was pitiful — the wretchedness of the rich 
— he, sick from impotence, aged by the cares of wealth; 
the daugliter contending with the contractors, striving 
to save their last chemises. There was less suffering in 
the famished alleys than in this rich man's house, where 
even water had to be drunk secretly. Work had not 
been resumed at Jean-Bart and it had been necessary 
to replace the pumps at Gaston-Marie; and in spite of 
all the haste made, an inundation had commenced 
which necessitated great outlay. Euin was becoming 
universal. Deneulin had at last risked an appeal for a 
loan of 6,000 francs from the Gregoires, whose refusal, 
though expected, finished him; if they refused it was from 
affection for him, to save him from a fruitless contest; 
and they counseled him to sell. He vehemently refused; 
it enraged him to pay the expenses of the strike, the 
blood rushing to his head and his throat choked with 
apoplexy; he hoped at first to die of it. What was 



GEEMINAL. 305 

there left to do? He had listened to the offers; they 
ridiculed him; they depreciated this superb plant, this 
repaired shaft newly equipped, where the want of funds 
alone prevented the working. Fortunate would lie be 
could he only extract enough to indemnify his creditors. 
For two days he had striven against the owners of 
Montson, furious at the cool manner in which they 
took advantage of his embarrassments, screaming 
'"never," with his loud voice, when they calmly an- 
nounced their resolution of returning to Paris to await 
his reply. 

And thus the matter stood. Etienne suspecting these 
compensations for disasters, was discouraged again by 
the invincible power of large capital, so strong on the 
battle-field enriched by the blood of the slain. Hap- 
pily on the morrow Jeanlin brought him good news. 
At Voreux the tubing of the shafts had broken up to 
such a degree that the water threatened the mine. 
Leaks appeared on all sides, and the corps of carpenters 
hastily summoned to make repairs, worked in constant 
danger. 

On the following night Etienne ran out for informa- 
tion. Up to that time he had avoided the Voreux 
where the eternal black shadow of the sentinel remained 
stationary above the plain. It could not be shut out 
from sight — there it was, commanding the whole region, 
like the flag of a regiment holding the country crushed 
and sullen. About three o'clock, the sky being cloudy, 
he went to the mine, where he was fortunate enough to 
meet Jouvarine. The machinist left his work at night. 
Briefly, he explained the bad state of the tubing, ad- 
ding that it was imprudent not to have it entirely 
re-made, as it would thus serve for two months' use. 
Then he spoke of the horses, whose unhappy fate alone 
touched him, his hatred of men causing his naturally 
tender heart to turn to animals. Had not the poor 
horses remained forty-eight hours without food at the 
time of the Montson disturbances ? And in scorn, he 
ridiculed the breaking of a few panes at the director's. 

" What a row about nothing ! I knew well that you 
would slave yourself to death to no purpose. . . . 
One little ton of powder, and it was so easy to blow up 
the store !" 
20 



306 GEEMIJSTAL. 

Enfeebled, Etienne replied: 

" Why don't you blow it up yourself? You astonish 
me, talking of demolishing everything, while you can't 
even fillip u fly!" 

Jouvarine opened his lips, looked him in the face, 
and withdrew silently, as if possessed by a fixed idea 
which seemed to glitter like a steel nail from the depths 
of his pale eyes. 

For a long time Etienne wandered around the mine, 
listening to the hammers of the carpenters working at 
the shaft. This gladdened his heart — this fresh wound 
which must be staunched; but the damage was never 
great enough; he in his turn, dreamed of destruction, a 
profound shock which would engulf a whole mine, 
without finding courage enough to set off the barrel of 
powder of which the machinist spoke; and words came 
back to him with the necessity of making a startling 
attempt to frighten the powerful and rouse the- people. 
At dawn, when Etienne decided to return, hefoundthe 
sentinel still posted on the dump. This time he must 
certainly be seen. He walked on, thinking of these 
soldiers taken from the people and armed against them. 
How easy would have been the triumph of the revolu- 
tion had the army promptly declared in its favor! It 
only required that the workman, the peasant in the 
barracks, should remember his origin. This was the 
great dread, the supreme peril which made the peasants 
grind their teeth when they thought of a possible de- 
sertion by the troops. In two hours they would be 
swi-pt off, thrown into the mine with all the spoils of 
their iniquitous life. Already it was said that whole 
regiments were infected with socialism. Was it true? 
Was justice coming, thanks to the cartridge boxes dis- 
tributed by the peasantry? And, sjjringing to another 
vision, Etienne beheld the regiment whose sentinels 
guarded the shaft, join the strikers, shoot the company 
en masse, and give the mine to the miners. He then 
perceived that he was ascending the dump, his head 
buzzing with these thoughts. Why should he not have 
a chat with this soldier? He v/ould know the color of 
his ideas. With an air of indifference, he continued his 
approach, as if he wished to gather the old bits of wood 



GERMINAL. 307 

remaining in the rubbish. The soldier remained mo- 
tionless. 

"Halloo, comrade, deuced bad weather!" at last said 
Etienne. "1 think we're going to have snow." 

He was a little soldier, very light complexioned, with 
a pale, mild face, covered with reddish spots. He 
seemed, in his watch-coat, to have the embarrassment 
of a recruit. 

"Yes, I think so too," he murmured. 

And with his blue eyes, he looked long at the livid 
sky, the smoky dawn, while the soot weighed like lead 
over the plain. 

" How stupid they are to plant you there to freeze 
your bones!" continued Etienne. " One would think 
they were expecting the Cossacks. . . . And there's 
alwa3's such a wind here." 

The little soldier shivered without complaint. There 
was, nevertheless, a stone hut where old Bonnemort 
took shelter in tempestuous nights, but the order was 
not to leave the summit of the dump, and the soldier 
remained at his post, his hands so stiff with cold that 
he no longer felt his gun. He belonged to the post of 
twenty-five men guarding Voreux; the worst of it was 
he had to return to this cruel post every third day; 
twice already, with frozen feet, he had risked being un- 
able to leave at" all. The profession required this; a 
passive obedience stupefied him at last, he replied to 
questions by wandering words liH? a dreaming child. 
In vain, for a quarter of an hour, Etienne endeavored to 
make him talk on politics. He said "yes" or "no" 
without appearing to understand; some of his comrades 
said that the captain was a republican; for himself, he 
had no idea — it was all the same to him. If he were 
commanded to fire, he would fire! he could not do 
otherwise. The workman listened with an access of the 
people's hatred of the army, against their comrades 
whose hearts they changed when putting them into the 
red pantaloons. 

"What's your name?" 

"Jules" 

"And where do you come from?" 

"From Plogof, over there?" 

By chance he had stretched out his arm. It was in 



308 GEllillNAL. 

Brittany — he knew no more. Ilis little pale face be- 
came animated; warmed again, he commenced to laugh. 

"I have my mother and my sister. They are expect- 
ing me very certainly. Ah ! it won't be for to-morrow. 
. . . When I left they came with me as far as Pont- 
I'Abbe. We had taken the Lepalmec's horse, and he 
nearly broke his hoofs at the foot of the Audierne hill. 
Cousin Charles was waiting for us with sausages, but 
the women were crying too much; they stuck in the 
throat. . . . Ah, my God! my God! how far it is 
from home!" 

His eyes moistened, while his laughter continued. 
The desert land of Plogof, that wild, storm-beaten cape 
of Raz, api^eared to him in dazzling sunlight in the 
rosy heather season. 

"Do tell me,'' said he, *'if I am not punished; do 
you think they would give me leave for one month in 
two years?" 

Then Etienne spoke of Provence, which he had left 
when quite small. The day wore on, flakes of snow 
commenced to float in the dull sky. And at last he 
became uneasy as he perceived jeanlin, wandering 
about the briers, with a stupefied look at seeing him up 
there. 

With a gesture the child called him. Why go on 
with this attempt at fraternizing with the soldiers? it 
would still take years to effect it — his fruitless effort 
dispirited him as much as if he had expected success. 

But instantly he understood Jeanlin's signal. They 
were coming to relieve the sentry and he went away, 
and with a run returned to his hiding place at Requil- 
lart, heart-broken once more by the certainty of defeat; 
Avhile the gamin, galloping near him, accused that dirty 
trooper of having called to the guard to fire on him. 

At the end of the dump, Jules remained motionless, 
amid the falling snow. The corporal approached with 
his men, the regulation calls were exchanged. 

" Who goes there? . . . Advance and give the 
countersign!" and the heavy steps were heard returning, 
reverberating as if in a conquered country. Notwith- 
standing the advanced hour, nothing stirred in the 
alleys; the whole of Montson remained silent and en- 
raged under the heel of the military. 



GERMINAL. 309 



CHAPTER XXXI. 

For two days the snow had fallen. It ceased in the 
morning. An intense frost iced the immense plain, 
and this black country, with inky roads, walls, and 
trees powdered with coal dust, was now all white, jDurely, 
beautifully white. Under the snow the alley of Deux- 
Cent-Quarante lay dead. Not eren the faintest cloud of 
smoke rose from the roofs. The fireless houses, cold as 
the stones on the road, did not melt the thick covering 
on the tiles. It was but a quarry of white flagstones in 
a white plain, the ghost of a dead village draped in its 
grave-clothes. The patrols, who alone passed, had left 
the length of the streets the muddy mess of their stamp- 
ing. At the Maheus, the last shovelful of coal 
cinders had been burned the night previous. It was 
impossible to think of gleaning on the dump in this ter- 
rible weather, when the sparrows could not find a blade 
of grass. Alzire, from perseveringly searching with 
her poor hands in the ice, was dying. La Maheu had 
wrapped her in a bit of blanket while awaiting Dr. 
Vanderhaghen, to whose house she had been twice with- 
out finding him. The maid promised nevertheless that 
monsieur would visit the alley before night, and the 
mother watched standing at the window. While the 
little invalid, who had wished to come down, remained 
with chattering teeth on a chair, deluded with the idea 
that it was warmer there near the cold oven. The 
father, Bonnemort, seated opposite, his legs attacked 
again, appeared to be sleeping. Neither Lenore nor 
Henri had returned yet, having left with Jeanlin to beg 
for sous on the road. Across the bare room Maheu 
alone walked heavily, stumbling at each turn against 
the wall, with the stupid look of an animal which no 
longer sees its cage. The petroleum was also finished, 
but the reflection of the snow without continued so 
white that it gave a vague light to the room, though 
night had fallen. 

There was a noise of sabots at the door and la Levaque 
entered like a whirlwind, crying from the threshold to 
la Maheu: 



310 GERMINAL. 

'*It was jon, then, who said that I forced my lodger 
to give me twenty sons!" 

The other shrugged her shoulders. 

" Don't bother me — I have said nothing. . . . 
Who told you that ? " 

"I was told that you said so, you need not know. 
And besides you said that you had heard 
our doings behind your partition. . . . Say again 
that you did not say so, eh V 

Quarrels broke out each day in consequence of the 
ceaseless gossip of the women, especially among the 
households living side by side, brickerings and recon- 
ciliations took place daily. But Tiever had such bitter 
malice set them by the ears. Since the strike, hunger 
aggravated their anger and prompted to blows ; the 
slightest altercation between two old gossips ended by 
murder between the two men. 

At that instant Levaque arrived, bringing in Boute- 
loup forcibly. 

" Here's the comrade — let him say whether he gave 
twenty sous to my wife." 

The lodger, his fear concealed by his large beard, 
protested and stammered : 

" Oh ! no; never anything, never ! 

Instantly Levaque became threatening, with his fist 
under Maheu's no^e. 

" You know that won't do for me. When one has a 
wife, if they like they'll break her back." 

'' But, great God !" cried Malieu, furious from being 
diverted from his melancholy. " What's all this fuss 
about ? Haven't we trouble enough already ? Shut up 
now or I'll give you a kick. Who said my wife said 
that?" 

*'La Pierronne." 

From that moment it was no longer possible to be 
heard. All were angry at tlie Mahens ; the Levaques 
asserted that la Pierronne had said many other things 
about them. 

'' Did she ?" cried Maheu. " Well, I'm going there 
and she'll have to take back what she says or I'll give 
her a knock in the jaw." 

He darted out; the Levaques followed as witnesses, 



GERMIXAL. 311 

while Bouteloup, who hated quarrels^ quietly went back 
home. 

La Maheu was going out also when a groan from 
Alzire held her back; she crossed the end of the blanket 
over the shivering body of the little one, and returned 
to her watch at the window. 

And still the doctor came not. Before Pierron's door 
Maheu and Levaque had Just found Lydie who was 
tramping through the snow. The house was shut; a 
glimmer of light came through a crack in the shutter, 
and the child at first replied to their questions with em- 
barrassment; no, her papa was not there, he had gone 
to the wash house to rejoin mother Brule, to bring back 
the bundle of clothes. Then she became uneasy, and 
would not say what her mother was doing. At last she 
told all, with a sullen and bitter laugh; her mother had 
put her out the door because M. Uansaert was there, 
and she prevented their talking. Since the morning he 
had been walking about the alley, from door to door, 
with two gendarmes, trying to entice workmen to en- 
gage to work, frightening the weak, announcing every- 
where that if they did not come down on Monday to 
the Voreux the company had decided to hire Belgians, 
and as night had fallen, he had sent back the gend- 
armes on finding la Pierronne alone; then he remained 
at her house to drink a glass of gin before the good fire. 

*'Hush! be quiet, we must see them! " said Levaque 
with his coarse laugh. 

" Yes, indeed," replied Maheu. *' Be off, little 
hussy! " 

Lydie drew back a few steps while he put an eye to 
the chink in the shutter. He stiffled a little cry, then 
la Levaque looked in; but she said that it disgusted 
her. Maheu, who had pushed her, saying that he also 
wished to see, declared that they had the worth of their 
money, and they commenced again, each in turn taking 
a peep, as at a comedy. The parlor, shining with neat- 
ness, was brightened by a large fire; there wei'e cakes 
on the table, with a bottle and two glasses; in short, a 
veritable feast; so much so, that what they saw within 
exasperated the two men, who under other circumstan- 
ces would have been entertained by it for six months. 

But, wasn't it piggish to have such a large fire and 



312 GERMINAL. 

be able to strengthen oneself with biscuits when one*s 
comrades hadn^t even a crust of bread or a cinder of 
coal ? 

" Here's papa/' cried Lydie, as she scampered off. 

Pierron was quietly returning from the wash-house 
with his bundle of clothing on his shoulder. Maheu im- 
mediately called him. 

"Say! I've been told that your wife has said some 
nasty things about us. I thmk you'd better look in your 
own house before you talk." 

Pierron could not understand, but when la Pierroune, 
seized with fear at hearing the noise, lost her wits so far 
as to half open the door to see what was the matter, the 
guilty pair were seen. The overseer rushed out, disap- 
pearing in the darkness, trembling that such a tale 
should reach the ears of the director, who had cautioned 
him to be prudent. Then followed a frightful row, 
mingled with laughter, hootings and reproaches. 

** You folks are nice ones to talk against your neigh- 
bors." 

'^Ah! she does well to speak!" resumed Levaque. 
" Here's a hussy who talked about my wife. Yes, and 
they told me you said so." 

But la Pierronne, herself again, with a scornful air, 
feeling herself the prettiest and the richest, replied: 

"I have said what I have said. Let me alone, will 
you? What business have you with my affairs, jealous 
fools ; angry with us because we put money in the 
savings' bank. Go! go! No matter what you say, my 
husband knows well why M. Dansaert was at our house." 

And, in truth, Pierron grew enraged and defended his 
wife. The quarrel took a new turn, and tliey said he 
had sold himself, called him a spy and the dog of the 
company; they accused him of shutting himself up to 
enjoy the good bits with which the chiefs paid him for 
his treachery. 

He, in replying, pretended that Maheu had threatened 
him, slipping a paper under his door with a skull and 
cross-bones upon it. And this ended inevitably by a 
fight among the men, similar to all the quarrels of the 
women, since hunger had roused the mildest. Mahen 
and Levaque pounced upon Pierron with their fists. 
They had to be separated. Blood streamed from the nose 



GEKMIXAL. 313 

of her son-in-law when la Brule, in her turn, came back 
from the wash-house. Matters being explained, she 
only said : 

" That pig there dishonors me." 

The street was empty, not a shadow fell on the 
wliiteuess of the snow; and the alley, to which the 
silence of death had returned, starved with hunger in 
the intense cold. 

''And the doctor?" asked Maheu, shutting the door 
again. 

" Xot come," replied la Maheu, still standing at the 
window. 

*' Have the little ones come in?" 

"No, they havVt." 

Maheu resumed his heavy tramping from one wall to 
the other, with the look of a stunned ox. Stiff on his 
chair old Bonnemort had not even raised his head. 
Alzire also said nothing, trying not to tremble, to spare 
their suffering; but in spite of her fortitude, she shook 
at times so violently that the shivering of her meagre 
little frame was heard against the blanket; whilst, with 
her large opened eyes, she watched on the ceiling the 
pale reflection of the gardens, all white, which lighted 
the room with the brilliancy of moonlight. The last 
agony had now arrived; the house was empty, and des- 
titution complete. The mattress cases had followed 
the wool to the broker's; then the sheets had gone, the 
clothes, everything that could be sold. One evening 
they had sold the grandfather's pocket-handkerchief for 
two sous. Tears fell as they parted with each article 
of the poor household, and the mother siill lamented 
the day she carried off, in her petticoat the pasteboard 
box, the old gift of her husband, as one would carry off 
a child to get rid of it under a door. They were strip- 
ped of everything at this hour; they had nothing more 
to sell but their skins, so scarred though that nobody 
would have wanted them. Xor did they even take the 
trouble to seek further; they knew there was nothing, 
that it was the end of all; they need not hope even for 
a candle, or a bit of bread, or a potatoe; and they 
awaited death; they were only sorry for the children. 

" Here he comes at last," said la Maheu. 

A dark form had just passed the window. The door 



314 GEEMINAL. 

opened. But it was not Doctor Vanderhaghen; they 
recognized the new Cure, the Abbe Ranvier, whose fiery 
eyes glittered in the darkness like the eyes of a cat. 
lie did not seem surprised to come upon this house of 
the dead, without light, without fire, without bread; 
already he had visited three other houses in the vicinity, 
he went from family to family, picking up willing men, 
like Dansaert with his gendarmes; immediately he ex- 
plained himself in his feverish priestly voice: 

" Why did you not come to mass on Sunday, my 
children? You are wrong; the church alone can save 
you. . . . Now promise me to come next Sunday." 

Maheu, after looking at him, resumed his heavy 
tramp without a word. It was la Maheu who replied : 

"To mass, M. le Cure — what for? -Isn^t the good 
God making game of us? Look, what has that little 
one there done to Him, shaking with fever? We had 
not enough misery, He must make her ill; when I can't 
even give her a cup of warm tisane.'' 

Then, standing, the priest spoke at length. He 
dwelt on the strike, its wretchedness, its bitterness ag- 
gravated by hunger, with the ardor of a missionary 
preaching to savages for the glory of his religion. He 
said that the church was with the poor, that she alone 
could one day make justice triumphant, in bringing down 
the wrath of God on the iniquities of the rich. And 
the day was coming, for the rich had taken the place of 
God, even governing without Him in their impious 
usurpation of power. But if the workmen wished the 
equitable division of the goods of the earth, they ought 
to place themselves in the hands of the priests, as at 
the death of Jesus the little ones and the humble ones 
grouped themselves round the apostles. What strength 
the pope would have, what an army would be at the 
disposal of the clergy, when they had the command of 
the mnumerable multitude of workmen! In a day the 
world would be purged of the wicked, the unworthy 
masters would be driven out, it would be, in short, the 
true reign of God, each one recompensed according to 
his merits, the law of labor insuring universal happi- 
ness. La Maheu, who listened to him, thought she 
was hearing Etienne in the autumn evenings, when he 



GERMINAL. 315 

anuonncecl to them the end of their troubles. Only, 
she always distrusted the Soutanes. 

"It's all very well, wliat you tell us tliere, M. le 
Cure," she said at last. '" But it must be that you no 
longer agree with the peasants, that you come back to 
the workmen at tliis hour. . . . All our other 
Cures dined with the administration, and threatened us 
with the devil as soon as we asked for bread." 

He commenced again, he spoke of the deplorable mis- 
understanding between the church and the people. In 
veiled phrases, he now struck at the clergy of the cities, 
at the bishops, at the high clergy, enervated with lux- 
ury, gorged with power, joining hands with the liberal 
peasantry, in their imbecile blindness, without seeing 
that it was this peasantry which was dispossessing them 
of worldly power. Deliverance would come from the 
country priests, all would one day rise to re-establish 
the reign of Christ, with the aid of the wretched; and 
he seemed to be already at their heads; he straightened 
his meagre form as if chief of the revolutionary bands 
of the gospel, his eyes filled with such a light that they 
illuminated the dark room. He was carried away by 
his enthusiasm into the use of mysterious words; for 
a long time the poor people had ceased to comprehend 
him. 

" It didn't need so much talk," growled Maheu, ab- 
ruptly. "You would have done better to commence 
by bringing us a loaf of bread." 

" Come to mass on Sunday," cried the priest. " God 
will provide for all." 

And he went away. He entered at the Levaques' to 
catechise them in their turn, so wrapped up in his 
dream of the final triumph of the church, having such 
scorn for the actual facts, that he went thus through 
the alley without alms, with empty hands, through this 
army dying with hunger, like a poor simpleton who 
looked upon suffering as the goad to salvation. Maheu 
had renewed his heavy march. Nothing was heard but 
this regular vibration, wliich shook the flag-stones. 
There was a sound like a pulley eaten by rust; the old 
Bonnemort spat into the cold hearth. Then the ca- 
dence of the steps re-commenced. Alzire, drowsy with 



316 GERMINAL. 

fever, became delirious, talking low, laughing, believing 
that it was warm and that she was playing in the snn. 

"D — nit!" murmured la Maheu, after touching her 
cheeks, " She is burning now. I don't wait for that 
pig any longer. Those thieves have stopped him from 
coming." 

She spoke of the doctor of the company. Neverthe- 
less, she uttered a joyful exclamation at seeing the door 
open again. But her arms fell again. She remained 
upright, with sombre look. 

"Good-evening," said Etienne, in a low voice, as 
soon as he had carefully shut the door again. 

He often arrived at the dead of night. La Maheu, 
since the second day, had learned his retreat. But they 
kept tlie secret. Kobody in the alley knew exactly 
what had become of the young man. This enveloped 
him in a kind of mystery. They still believed in him. 
Mysterious rumors were afloat; he v/ould reappear with 
an army, with cliests full of gold; and it was always the 
religious expectation of a miracle, the ideal reality, the 
brusque entry into the city of justice he had prom.ised 
them. Some said tlieyhiid seen him in a carriage, in 
company with three gentlemen, on the road to Mar- 
chiennes. Others affirmed that he had been in England 
for two days. In the end, however, distrust commenced. 
The jokers accused him of hiding himself in a cave, 
where Moquette kept him warm: for this liaison had 
done him injury. It was, in the midst of his popu- 
larity, a gradual disaffection, the deafness springing 
from desperation, and tlie numbers of the dissatisfied 
were increasing. 

" Wiiat beastly weather! " he continued, still stand- 
ing, " And yet nothing new, always worse and worse? 
I was told that little Negrel had gone to Belgium to 
engage workmen. Ah! in God's name, we are lost if it 
be true! " 

A shiveriiig fit had seized him on entering this icy 
and dark raom, where his eyes could only gradually 
discover the unfortunate creatures whom he guessed 
were there. He experienced a vague repugnance, that 
uneasiness of tlie workman who has left his class, 
sharpened by study, moved by ambition. What a 
nausea from the sulïering, and the odor, and the bodies 



GERMIS-AL. 317 

crowded together, and the pity which choked his throat! 
He came to tell them of his discouragement, and the 
sight of this agony in such misery upset him to such a 
degree that he sought for words to counsel submission. 
But with vehemence Maheu had planted himself before 
him: 

"Belgians! they wouldn't dare, the fools! Let them 
bring down the Belgians, if they want us to destroy the 
shafts." 

Then with embarrassment Etienne explained that 
they could not stir, that the soldiers who guarded the 
shafts would protect the descent of the Belgian work- 
men. And Maheu clenched his fists more enraged, 
irritated above all as he said, at having these bayonets 
in the back. The coal men were no longer then masters 
at home? They were treated as galley slaves, conducted 
to their work, gun in hand ! He loved his pit; it 
grieved him not to have gone down it for two months. 
Thus he flushed at the thought of the injury with which 
he was threatened in attempting the introduction of 
strangers. Then, suddenly, the recollection that he 
had been discharged returned to him, breaking his 
heart. 

"I don't know why I grieve," murmured he. "I 
don't belong to their barracks any more. . . . When 
they have driven me from here, 1 can die on the road." 

" JSTonsense! " said Etienne. "If you choose they 
will take you back to-morrow. Good workmen are not 
sent av/ay." 

He interrupted himself, astonished to hear Alzire 
laughing softly in the delirium of fever. He liad only 
as yet made out the stiff form of Pere Bonnemort, and 
this gaiety of the sick child frightened him. It was too 
mii;;h this time, if the little ones died of it. With 
trembling voice, he came to a decision. 

*•' Let's see — this cannot continue." 

"Y'fe are all fools — it would be better to surrender." 

La Maheu, motionless and silent thus far, burst out 
all at once, screaming in his face, and swearing like a 
man. 

"What is that you say? It's yoic who say that, good 
God." 



318 GERMINAL. 

He wished to give reasons, but she would not let him 
speak. 

"In God's name, don't repeat it! or woman as I am 
I'll strike you in the face. . . . Then, we have 
starved for two months; I liave sold my furniture; my 
children have fallen sick; and nothing has been gained 
and injustice recommences. Ah! do you see, when I 
think of that, my blood chokes me! No! no! I'll burn 
all, I'll kill all now, rather than surrender. Maheu had 
resumed his walk; she pointed to him, in the darkness, 
Avith a menacing gesture." 

" Listen to this, if my man returns to the shaft, it is 
I who will wait for him over there and spit in his face, 
and treat him as a coward! " 

Etienne could not see her, but he felf a heat like that 
of a barking dog, and he had drawn back in the face of 
this rage which was his work. He found her so changed 
that he did not recognize her former wisf^om, reproach- 
ing his violence, saying that one ought not to desire 
any one's death; and now refusing to hear reason and 
speaking of killing everybody. Here she was talking 
politics, wanting to sweep out with one stroke the gov- 
ernment and the peasantry, calling for the republic and 
the guillotine, to rid the earth of these rich robbers, 
fattening on the labor, the hunger-slain. 

"Yes, with my ten fingers, I'd strangle them. . . . 
Perhaps they have had enough! our turn has come; you 
said so yourself. . . . When I think that the father, 
grandfather, great grandfather, and all before them, 
have suffered what we have suffered, and that our sons, 
and our sons' sons will suffer it again, it maks me crazy 
— I'd take a knife if I were a man. We didn't do 
enough the other day. We ought to have torn down 
Montson to the ground, even to the last brick. And, 
don't you know? I've but one regret — that I didn't let 
the old man strangle la Piolaine's daughter; they don't 
mind that my little ones are strangled by hunger!" 

Her words fell, in the night, like the blows of an axe. 
The closed horizon could not re open; the unattainable 
ideal turned to poison in this brain, crazed by suffering. 

"You misunderstood me," at last Etienne was able 
to say, retreating. "We ought to arrive at some under- 
standing with the company; I know that the mines 



GERMINAL. 319 

suffer miicli; doubtless they will consent to some ar- 
rangement." 

'•No, not at all!" she screamed. 

And, at this instant, Lenore and Henri came in, with 
empty hands. A gentleman had given them two sous, 
though, but as they were always fighting together — the 
sister kicking the little brother, the two sous had fallen 
in the snow; and Jeunlin, who was accompanying them, 
had searched for them with them, but they had not 
found them. 

"Where is Jeanlin?" 

" He's gone off, mamma, he said he had something to 
do." 

Etienne listened, broken-hearted. Formerly she 
threatened to kill them if they ever asked alms. And 
to-day, she herself sent them on the roads; she spoke of 
their all going, the ten thousand coal men of Montson, 
taking the staves and wallets from the poor old men, 
and foraging through the terrified country. 

Then the agony increased in the dark room. The 
brats had come in hungry, they wanted to eat; why 
weren't they eating? they began to moan, dragged 
themselves on the ground, and finished by throwing 
themselves on the legs of their dying sister, who 
groaned faintly. Beside herself, the mother cuffed 
them in the darkness. Then, as they cried louder, ask- 
ing for bread, she burst into tears, sank on the floor, 
seizing them and the sick child in one tight embrace; 
and for a long time her tears flowed, in a nervous ex- 
citement which left her softened, exhausted, muttering 
twenty times the same phrase, begging for death. '• My 
God, why don't you take us? My God, in pity, take us 
and end it!" The grandfather continued motionless 
like an old tree shorn by the rain and the wind, while 
the father continued his walk from the chimney to the 
door, without turning his head. 

But the door opened again, and this time is was Doc- 
tor Yanderhaghen. 

"The devil," said he, "a candle would not ruin your 
eyesight. ... Be quick, I am in a hurry." 

He grumbled as usual, tired out with work. Fortu- 
nately he had matches, and the father had to light six, 
one at a time, and hold them while he examined the 



320 GERMINAL. 

p.itient. Unwound from her blanket, she shivered 
under this flickering light, looking like a poor little 
wretched bird agonizing in the snow, so thin that her 
hump only was seen. She smiled nevertheless, the 
wandering smile of the dying, with her eyes wide open, 
while her poor hand clutched her hollow breast. And, 
as the mother cried still louder, asking if it were rea- 
sonable to take, before her, the only child that heljoed 
her in the household, the doctor grew angry. 

"There! she's going. . . . She has died of 
hunger, your d — d brat. And she is not the only 
one; I have seen another next door. You all call me, 
and I can do nothing; it is meat that you want." 

Maheu, with burnt fingers, had thrown away the 
match ; darkness fell again on the little corpse, still 
warm. The doctor had hurried off, Etienne heard 
nothing in the dark room but the sobs of la Maheu, 
who kept repeating her mournful and ceaseless prayer 
for death, 

" My God ! it's my turn ; take me ! My God ! take 
my man ; in pity take the others and end it." 



CHAPTER XXXII. 



Since nine o'clock on that Sunday Jouvarine remained 
alone in the saloon of l'Avantage in his usual place 
with his head against the wall. More than one coal 
man did not know where to find two sous for a drink ; 
never had the place liad fewer customers. So Mme. 
Rasseneur, stationed at the counter, was sullenly silent, 
while Rasseneur, standing in front of the chimney, 
seemed to be watciiing with an air of reflection the 
black coal smoke. Suddenly, in the dull silence of the 
overheated room, three little sharp knocks at one of the 
window panes made Jouvarine turn his head. He rose, 
recognizing the signal of which Etienne had several 
times made use to call him, when he saw him from the 
outside smoking his cigarette, seated at an empty table. 
But before the machinist reached the door, Rasseneur 
had o])ened it ; and, recognizing the man who was 
there, in the light from the window, he said to him : 



GEEMIKAL. 321 

" Are you afraid that I shall betray you ? "We can 
talk better inside than outside." Etienne entered. But 
he refused the drink which Mme. Kasseneur politely 
offered him. The tavern-keeper added ■ 

" A long time ago I guessed where you were hiding. 
If I was a spy, as your friends say, I could have sent 
the gendarmes to you eight days ago." 

" There is no need to defend yourself," replied the 
young man. " I know that is not in your line. With- 
out sharing the same ideas, we may esteem each other 
nevertheless." 

And silence reigned again. Jouvarine had reseated 
himself with his back against the wall, his eyes 
lost in the smoke of his cigarette, but his feverish 
fingers moved uneasily as he rubbed them along his 
knees seeking the warm Polish nap of the trousers 
which he had not put on that evening, and he felt that 
something was missing, not knowing exactly what it 
was. 

Seated at the other side of the table, Etienne said at 
last: 

" To-morrow work will be resumed at Voreux, The 
Belgians have arrived with little Negrel." 

" Yes, I saw them pass," said Easseneur, still stand- 
ing. " Provided we don't kill ourselves yet!" 

Then, raising his voice, "'No, you see I don't want 
to renew our dispute. It can only end badly if you con- 
tinue so obstinate. . . . See! your story is precisely 
that of your International. I saw Pluchart the otlier 
day at Lille, where I had business. His machine is out 
of order apparently. 

He gave details. The Association, after having won 
over the whole of the workmen to an enthusiasm in the 
propaganda, which made the peasantry still shudder, 
was now devoured and weakened more and more day by 
day by the petty internal dissensions prompted by 
vanity and ambition. Since the triumph of the anar- 
chists in driving out their predecessors, the evolutionists, 
everything was breaking up, the original aim, the reform 
in the scale of wages, was lost in party bickerinc^s, and 
the official lists became disorganized from hatred of dis- 
cipline. And even now might be predicted the final 

21 



323 GEKMINAL. 

overthrow of this levy en masse, which for a moment, 
had threatened to blow away the rotten old gentry. 

" Pluchart is sick of it," continued Rasscneur. " He 
has no more voice, but he speaks nevertheless, and he 
wishes to go to Paris to speak. . . . And he re- 
peated to me three times that the game was up with our 
strike. Etienne, with his eyes on the ground, let him 
go on without interruption. The evening previous he 
had talked with some comrades, and he felt a breath of 
bitterness and suspicion — those harbingers of unpopu- 
larity announcing defeat. He remained gloomy. He 
would not own his discouragement before a man who 
had predicted that the mob would howl at him in his 
turn on the day when a mistake had to be avenged. 

"Without a doubt the strike is broken up. I know 
it as well as Pluchart," said he, at last. " But that was 
anticipated. We accepted this strike unwillingly. We 
did not expect to conquer the company by it. . . . 
But that is the way, we intoxicate ourselves; we begin 
to hope this and tliat, and when things go wrong we 
forget that we ought to have expected it; we lament and 
we dispute as under a misfortune sent by Heaven." 

"Well, then," replied Rasseneur, "if you believe the 
cause lost, why don't you make your comrades listen to 
reason ? " 

The young man looked at him fixedly. 

"Listen — this is enough. . . . You have your 
ideas, I have mine. I came in here to show you that I 
esteem you notwithstanding. But I still hold that if we 
die of want and suffering our famished bodies will do 
more for the people's cause than your prudent logic. 
Ah! if one of these hogs of soldiers could only put a 
ball in my heart, how glorious it would be to end thus!" 

His eyes had moistened in this cry, where the secret 
desired by the conquered was betrayed, seeking the 
refuge which would end his torment forever. 

"Well said!" exclaimed the hard voice of Madame 
Rasseneur, with the scorn of all her radical opinions in 
the look she cast upon her husband. 

Jouvurine, his eyes in a cloud and groping with his 
hands nervously, did not seem to have heard a word. 
His blonde, girlish face, thin nose, small pointed teeth, 
grew savage in a mystic reverie, traversed by bloody 



GEKMINAL. 323 

visions, and he commenced to dream aloud. He n plied 
to a word of Rasseneur's about the International, caught 
in tlie midst of the conversation. 

"They are all cowards! It needed but one m.an to 
make tlieir machine the terrible instrument of destruc- 
tion. But the will is wanting. Nobody will do it, and 
that is why the I'evolution will fail again.'' 

He continued, in a tone of disgust, to deplore the 
imbecility of men, while the two others were troubled 
by these revelations of the somnambulist and made to the 
darkness. 

In Russia nothing was going on. He w^as in despair 
at the news he had received the night before. His old 
comrades were all becoming politicians ; the famous 
Nihilists who made Europe tremble, the priests, the 
peasants, the merchants had not a thought beyond 
national liberty, and seemed to think that the killing of 
the despot would free the world ; and the moment he 
spoke to them of mowing down this old race like a ripe 
harvest, the moment he pronounced the word republic, 
he felt they could not understand him; they were made 
uneasy, and classed him thenceforth with those princes 
who had missed fire in the revolutionary universe. 

His patriotic heart struggled notwithstanding; it was 
with mournful bitterness that he repeated his favorite 
word: ''Stupidity! . . . With their stupidity they 
will never get out of it !" 

Then, still lowering his voice he related in bitter 
words his old dream of paternity. He had only re- 
nounced his rank of fortune to join the workmen, in 
the hope of thus at last establishing the new society of 
general labor. All the sous in his pockets had long ago 
been transferred to the gamins of the alley; he"^ had 
treated the coalmen with the tenderness of a brother, 
smiling at their distrust, and conquering them by his 
quiet air of a steady workman little given to talking. 
But, decidedly, the fusion did not take place; he re- 
mained a stranger to them, with his disdain of all 
bonds. And he was especially exasperated, since the 
morning, by reading a piece of nev/s going the rounds 
of the papers. His voice changed, his eyes glittered, 
fixed themselves on Etienne, and he addressed him 
directly: "Do you understand that? The workmen hat- 



324 GEEMINAL. 

ters of Marseilles, who have gained the great sum of a 
hundred thousand francs, immediately bought houses 
declaring that they were going to live without doing 
anything! Yes, that's your idea, all of you French 
workmen — to unearth a treasure and then devour it 
alone in a corner of egotism and idleness. What 
matters your crying out against the rich; courage fails 
you to give to the poor the money that fortune sends 
you. You will never be worthy of happiness so long as 
you keep anything for yourselves, and your hatred of 
the peasantry springs only from your wrathful desire to 
be in their place." 

Easseneur began to laugh; the idea that the two 
Marseilles workmen ought to have given up that big 
sum seemed ridiculous to him. But Jouvarine grew 
pale; his disturbed face became frightful in one of those 
religious phrensies which exterminate nations. He 
cried: "You will all be cut down and thrown on the 
refuse heap. He will be born — he who will annihilate 
your race of cowards and triflers. And, look! you see 
my hands; if my hands could do so, they would take 
the earth thus and bi'eak it all into such little pieces 
that you would be buried under them." 

" Well said! " repeated Madame Easseneur, with her 
air of polite conviction. 

Silence followed. Then Etienne spoke of the work- 
men of the Bolinage; he questioned Jouvarine on the 
measures that had been taken at Voreux. But the 
machinist, again preoccupied, hardly answered; only 
knew that cartridges were to be distributed among the 
soldiers guarding the shafts; and the nervous move- 
ment of his fingers over his knees increased to such a 
degree that he finally became conscious of what they 
were seeking — the soft nap and fur of the familiar rab- 
bit skin. 

" Where is Pologne? " asked he. 

The tavern-keeper laughed again, looking at his wife. 
After a little embarrassment he unbent his brows. 
"Pologne? She is at the fire." Since her adventure 
with Jeanlin, the fat rabbit, wounded doubtless, had 
only borne dead rabbits, and not to feed a useless 
mouth they had decided on that very day to serve her 
up with potatoes. 



GERMINAL. 325 

" Yes, you ate one of her thighs this evening. . . . 
And you licked your finers after it!" 

Jouvarine had not understood at first. Then he 
grew very pale, nausea contracted his chin; whilst in 
spite of his stoicism two large tears swelled his eyelids. 
But there was not time to notice his emotion; the door 
was rudely opened, and Cheval appeared, pushing 
Catherine before him. For three hours he had been 
running through the taverns of Moutson, soaking him- 
self with beer and swaggering. The idea had come to 
him to go to l'Aventure to show the old people that he 
was not afraid. He entered, saying to his mistress: 

^ "D nit! I say you shall drink a glass in there; 

I'll break the jaw of the first one who scowls at mel " 

At the sight of Etienne Catherine turned white. 
"When Cheval perceived him he said, with a malicious 
sneer: 

"Madame Easseneur, two glasses! We will drink in 
honor of the resumption of labor." 

Like a woman, who refuses beer to no one, she poured 
it out without a word. All were silent; neither the 
tavern-keeper nor the two others had stirred from their 
places. 

"I know some who have said that I was a spy," re- 
sumed Cheval arrogantly, " and I am waiting for them 
to say it to my face, so that we may explain ourselves 
at last." 

No one replied; the men turned their heads, staring 
vacantly at tlie walls. 

" There are idlers, and those who are not idlers," 
continued he, louder; "as for me, I've nothing to hide. 
I've left the dirty barracks at Deneulin, and go down 
to-morrow to Voreux with twelve Belgians placed under 
my charge because they like me, and if this displeases 
any one, let me know, and we will talk it ovei'." 

Then, as his threats were received with the same con- 
temptuous silence, he grew angry with Catherine. 

"D n it! will you drink! Drink with me to the 

confusion of all the hogs who refuse to work." 

She touched her glass to his, but with such a trem- 
bling hand that the slight tinkling of the two glasses 
was heard. 

He, meanwhile, had drawn from his pocket a handful 



326 GERMINAL. 

of silver cliange, which he spread out with the ostenta- 
tion of a drunkard, saying that it was by the sweat of 
his brow that he had earned it, and defying the slug- 
gards to show as much as ten sous. The manner of his 
comrades exasperated him, and at last he became grossly 
insultfng. 

" It's at night, then, the toads go out? The gen- 
darmes must be asleep, that we meet with thieves?'' 

Etienne had risen calm and resolute. 

"Listen! You astonish me! . . . Yes, you are 
a spy! Your money still smells of treachery, and it dis- 
gusts me to touch your traitorous skin; but no matter. 
I'm your man; for a long time it has been necessary 
that one of us should make an end of the other." 

Cheval clenched his fists. 

"Come along, then; you wanted something to stir 
you up, you coward! I want you alone, and now I'll 
make you pay for the dirty tricks that have been played 
upon me!" 

With supplicating gesture, Catherine advanced be- 
tween them. But they had not the trouble of pushing 
her back. She felt the necessity of the battle, and 
slowly drew back herself. She stood mutely against a 
table, so paralyzed with anguish that she no longer 
shivered, with her large eyes fixed on these two men 
who were about killing each other for her. 

Madame Easseneur simply carried away the glasses 
belonging to her counter, for fear they should be broken, 
when she reseated herself on the little bench, without 
showing any unbecoming curiosity. But two old com- 
rades could not be allowed to throttle each other thus. 
Easseneur tried to intervene, and Jouvarine had to take 
him by the shoulder and bring him back to the table, 
saying: 

"It is none of your business. There is one too many. 
The strongest must live." 

Already, without waiting for the attack, Cheval 
struck into the air with his closed fists. He w;is the 
taller, ill-formed, aiming at the face with furious blows 
from both arms, one after the other, as if mnnœuvering 
with a pair of sabers. And he continued to talk. He 
was posing for the gallery, Avith a stream of execrations 
which excited him. 



GERMINAL. 327 

"Ah ! you d — d villain, I'll have your nose. It's your 
nose that I want to mash. Give me your jaw, then, that 
I may make a bouilli for the hogs with it, and we'll see 
then if the women will run after you any more!" 

Mute, with clenched teeth, Etienne drew up his small 
figure, playing the scientific game, the chest and face 
covered by his two fists; and he watched, then struck 
out in terribly sharp and well-aimed blows. At first, 
little harm was done. The wind-mill knocks of the 
one, the calm waiting of the other, prolonged the 
struggle. A chair was upset; their large shoes crushed 
the white sand sprinkled on the fioor. They soon were 
out of breath; their hoarse breathing became audible, 
and their faces reddened, as if from an internal brazier, 
whose flames could be seen through their eyes. 

"Hit!" screamed Cheval; "down with your carcass!" 

In truth, his fist, flung slopingly, like a flail, had 
crunched the shoulder of his adversary. He repressed 
a cry of pain. There was nothing but the faint noise 
of the crushing of the muscles. And he replied by a 
straight blow, full on the breast, which would have 
broken it in if the other had not sprung aside in his 
constant leaps like a goat. Nevertheless, the blow 
struck him on the left side so forcibly that he reeled 
with suspended breath. Enraged to find his arms 
weakening from pain, he roared like a beast, and aimed 
at the stomach, to split it open, with his heel. 

" I'll split you into bits," cried he, his voice almost 
suffocated. 

Etienne avoided the blow, so indignant at this in- 
fraction of the laws of the ring that he broke silence: 

"Hold your tongue, brute! and put down your feet, 
or I'll mash you to pieces with a chair!" 

Then the fight grew more serious, Rasseneur, dis- 
gusted, would again have intervened but for the severe 
look of his wife which restrained him; hadn't two cus- 
tomers a right to settle an affair at their house? So he 
only placed himself before the chimney, for he feared 
to see them fall into the fire. Jouvarine, with his quiet 
air, had rolled up a cigarette, which, however, he forgot 
to light. Catherine remained motionless against the 
wall; her hands only in unconscious movement twisting 
themselves and tearing out pieces of her dress. All 



328 GERMINAL. 

her effort was to utter no cry; not to kill one of them 
by showing a preference; and she was so bewildered 
besides that she no longer knew which she liked best or 
whose death she awaited. 

Cheval was exhausted, bathed in perspiration, strik- 
ing at hazard. In spite of his wrath Etienne continued 
to guard himself, parrying nearly all the blows; though 
some gjazed him. His ear was split, a nail tore off a 
strip of his neck and, with such a smarting, that he 
swore in his turn in giving one of his terrible straight- 
forward blows. Once more Cheval saved his chest by a 
jump, but he had stooped, the fist reached his face, 
crushed his nose and drove in his eye. Instantly a 
stream of blood poured from his nostrils, the eye in- 
flamed, swelled up and turned blue. ' The miserable 
wretch, blinded by this red flood, dizzy from his 
stunned brain, was striking the air wildly with his 
arms, when another blow, full in the breast at last 
finished him. There was a frightful crash; he fell on 
his back with a dull sound like a bag of sand. Etienne 
waited. " Get up. If you want any more, we'll begin 
again." 

Without replying. Cheval, after a few seconds of 
stupefaction, moved himself on the ground and 
stretched his limbs. He gathered himself up with dif- 
ficulty and remained an instant on his knees, like a ball, 
with his right hand unseen in his pocket, then, when 
on foot, he roared again with savage fury. 

But Catherine had seen; and in spite of herself, by 
the great cry which sprung from her heart, and aston- 
ished her like the avowal of a preference of which she 
was herself unconscious, she warned the young man. 

" Take care! he has his knife! " 

Etienne only had time to parry the first thrust with 
his arm. His clothing was cut by the thick blade — one 
of those bladfs with a brass ferrule fixed in a wooden 
handle. He seized ChevaFs arm; a frightful struggle 
commenced, for he felt that he was lost if he let go of 
that arm, while the other shook him to free himself 
and strike. The weapon was lowered gradually; the 
stiff limbs grew weary; twice Etienne had felt the cold 
steel against his flesh; he must make a supreme effort; 
and he clenched the wrist with such a grasp that the 



GERMINAL. 329 

knife slipped from the open hcind. Both had fallen on 
the floor; it was he who picked it up, brandishing it in 
his turn. He held Cheval on his face, under his knee; 
he threatened to cut his throat. 

"Ah! traitor, your time has come! " 

A horrible voice witliin deafened him. It pervaded 
his whole body, thundering in his head like the strokes 
of a hammer, a sudden rage for murder, a thirst for 
blood. Never had the crisis affected him thus. Never- 
theless, he was not drunk. And he fought against the 
hereditary curse with the shivering desperation of a 
passionate lover fighting against temptation on the 
brink of crime. He conquered himself at last; he 
threw the knife behind him, stammering hoarsely: 

"Get up! be off!" 

This time Rasseneur rushed forward, but without 
risking himself between them, in the fear of receiving a 
heavy blow. He did not want anybody to be assassin- 
ated at his house. He was so angry that his wife, 
standing at the counter, told him that he always cried 
out too soon. Jouvarine, who had narrowly escaped 
receiving the knife in his legs, decided on lighting his 
cigarette. That was the end then? Catherine looked 
stupidly at the two men, still alive. 

"Be off! "repeated Etienne; "be off or I'll finish 
you." 

Cheval got up; with the back of his hand wiped the 
blood, which continued to flow from his nose, and, 
with his Jaw covered with bloody stains, and his eye 
crushed, he went off, dragging his legs after him, en- 
raged at his defeat. Mechanically, Catherine followed 
him. Then, straightening himself, his hatred burst 
forth in a stream of filthiness. 

"Ah! no; ah! no; since it is him you want, let him 
take care of you, vile hussy. And if you value your 
skin, don't show yourself at my house again." 

He slammed the door violently. A profound silence 
pervaded the room, broken only by the slight crackling 
of the coal-cinders. On the floor there only remained 
the overturned chair and a spattering of blood, soaking, 
by drops, into the "sanded floor, 



330 GERMINAL. 



CHAPTER XXXIII. 

When they had left Rasseneur's, Etienne and Cath- 
erine walked in silence. The thaw was beginning — a 
cold, slow thaw which blackened the snow without 
melting it. In the livid sky one could see the full 
moon behind heavy clouds, like dark rags, which a 
tempestuous wind waved furiously on high. And on 
the earth not a breath stirred; nothing was heard but 
the dropi^ings from the roofs, whence white flakes fell 
softly. 

Etienne, embarrassed by this woman forced upon 
him, could find nothing tosay. The idea of taking and 
hiding her with him at Requillart seemed absurd to 
him. He had spoken at first of conducting her to the 
alley to her parent's house; but she refused, with a ter- 
rified air. No, no; anything rather than return to 
those whom she had left so shamefully! And neither 
spoke again. They wandered on .through roads which 
were changing into muddy streams. At first, they had 
descended toward Voreux, when they turned to the 
right and passed between the dump and the canal. 

"You must sleep somewhere," said he, at last. "If 
I had even a room, I would be willing to take you. 
But he suddenly became timid. Their past a]tpeared; 
their large hopes of old, and the refined bashfulness 
which had kept them apart. Did he really like her, 
that he was thus troubled and his heart warming afresh 
Avith an unknown desire? The recollection of tlie box 
on the ear which she had given him at Gaston-Marie 
excited him now, instead of filling bim with bitterness. 
And to his surprise, the idea of taking her to Requil- 
lart seemed quite natural to him already. 

"Come, decide; where do you want me to take you? 
You hate me a good deal then, that you refuse to come 
with me?" She walked slowly, with the painful slip- 
ping of her sabots in the ruts; and without raising her 
head, she murmured: "I have* trouble enough; my 
God! don't make me ;iny more. What good would 
that do us — that which you ask now when I have a 
lover and you, yourself have a girl," 



GERMINAL. 331 

She was speaking of Moquette. She believed he was 
with this girl, as was the report for a fortnight past; 
and when he swore that it was not so, she shook her 
head, remembering the evening she had seen them ex- 
changing kisses under a street-lamp in Montson. 

"Isn't all tliis nonsense a pity?" said he in alow 
voice, and stopping. "We would have understood 
each other so well! " 

She shivered slightly, and replied: 

" Go — regret nothing, you don't lose much. If you 
knew how I am worn out! I shall never reach mature 
years! 

"My poor little creature," said Etienne, filled with 
pity. 

They were below the dump, hidden in the shade of 
the immense piles. A cloud, black as ink, was just pass- 
ing over the moon; they could not even see each other's 
faces, and, their breaths intermingled, their lips sought 
each other for the kiss for which they had been longing 
for months past. But suddenly the moon re-appeared, 
they saw above them, above the white rocks, the sentry 
from Voreux, erect and facing them! And without 
having exchanged the kiss, bashfulness separated them; 
the old bashfulness mixed with anger, vague repugnance 
and strong attraction. They wearily resumed their 
walk, plodding through the mud ankle deep. 

"It's decided, you won't?" asked Etienne. 

"No," said she. "You, after Cheval, eh? and after 
you, another. . . . No, that disgusts me." 

They were silent, walking a hundred steps without 
exchanging a word. 

"Do you know where you're going, at least?" he re- 
sumed. " I can't leave you out doors on such a night." 

She replied simply: " I am going back again. Cheval 
is my man after all, and I have no business anywhere 

"*But he'll beat you to death!" 

Silence fell again. She shrugged her shoulders re- 
signedly. He would beat her, and when tired of beat- 
ing her he would stop; was not even that better than 
wandering about the roads like a beggar? Besides she 
was accustomed to slaps; she said, to console herself 
that among ten women, eight fared no better than her- 



332 GERMINAL. 

self. If her lover married her some day, it would still 
be a kind act on his part. Etienne and Catherine had 
mechanically taken the road toward Montson, and as 
they approached it, their intervals of silence lengthened. 
It seemed as if they had never been friends. He found 
no means of convincing her, in spite of the heavy grief 
he experienced in seeing her return to the other one. 
His heart swelled that he had nothing better to offer 
her than a life of wretchedness and flight from ])ursuit 
— a night perhaps without a morrow, if a soldier's bullet 
cracked his skull. Perhaps, after all, it was better to 
bear the suffering of the present, Avithout risking more. 
And he reconducted her to her lover's with drooping 
head, and made no remonstrance, when, on the high- 
way, she stopped him at the corner of the Chantiers, 
at fifty metres from the Piquette coffee-house, saying: 

"Don't come any further. If he saw you he would 
be still more savage." 

The church clock was striking eleven. La Piquette 
was closed, but there was light under the door. 

"Good-bye," she said; "don't stay here, I beg of you; 
it makes me afraid." 

She had given him her hand; he kept it, and painfully 
and slowly she withdrew it to leave him. Without 
turning her head she went in by the little door with her 
latch-key. But he did not withdraw, remaining stand- 
ing in the same place, his eyes fixed in anxiety to know 
what would take place. He bent his car; he feared to 
hear the groans of a beaten woman. The house remained 
dark and silent; a window on the first story alone was 
lighted, and, as it opened and he recognized the slight 
form leaning out, he advanced, 

Catherine then whispered very low: 

" He hasn't come back. I'm going to bed. . . . 
I beg you to leave!" 

Etienne went away. The thaw increased ; a stream 
ran from the roofs, dampness streamed from the walls, 
the palisades, from all the crowded buildings of this in- 
dustrial suburb, lost in this gloomy night. He returned 
at first towards Requillart, ill from fatigue and sadness, 
seized with a longing to disappear unclergound and 
annihilate himself there. Then the thought of the 
Voreux returned to him ; he thought of the Belgian 



GERMINAL. 333 

workmen who were coming down; of his comrades of 
the alley, exasperated against the soldiers, resolved not 
to tolerate strangers in their mine. And again he 
traversed the canal, amid the flakes of melting snow. 
As he neared the dump the moon shone out clearly. He 
raised his eyes, looked at the sky, v,'here the clouds were 
hurrying past, spurred on by the wind above; but they 
whitened and thinned into pale mist as they filed across 
the face of the moon, following each other so rapidly 
that the orb, veiled for a moment at times, increasingly 
reappeared in its limpid beauty. 

Engrossed with this pure light, Etienne was bending 
his head, when a spectacle at the summit of the terrace 
arrested him. The sentry, stiff with cold, was walking 
novv; taking twenty-five steps towards Marchiennes, and 
then turning towards Montson. The white sparkle of 
his bayonet could be seen above this black shadow, 
clearly defined against the pale sky. And that which 
interested the young man was that behind the hut 
which sheltered Bonnemort in stormy nights, there was 
a moving shadow, a crouching beast on the Avatch, in 
whom he immediately recognized Jeanlin, with his 
long, thin, bony form. The sentry could not see him; 
the little rascal was certainly preparing some trick, for 
he hated the soldiers and asked when they would be rid 
of those murderers who came with guns to kill every- 
body. For a moment Etienne hesitated about calling 
to him to stop his nonsense. The moon was obscured; 
he had seen him gather himself up ready to spring, but 
the moon shone out and the child remained crouching. 
At each turn the sentry advanced as far as the hut and 
then went back again. Suddenly, as a cloud cast its 
shadow, Jeanlin leaped upon the shoulders of the sol- 
dier, with the tremendous s})ring of a wild-cat, and 
clutching him with his claws, drove his open knife into 
his throat. The horse-hair collar resisted; he had to 
grasp the handle with both hands and hang on it the 
whole weight of his body. lie had often thus bled 
chickens which he caught behind the farms; it was so 
rapidly done, that a single stifled cry only broke on the 
night, while the gun fell with a metallic sound. Al- 
ready the white moon was sliining brilliantly. Immov- 
able from stupor, Etienne still looked on. His call had 



334 GERMINAL. 

died îiwiiy in his breast. Above, the dump was empty, 
not another shadow fell from the flying clouds. He 
ran up and found Jeanlin on his hands and knees before 
the corpse, fallen back with outstretclied arms. In the 
snow, under the clear light, the red pantaloons and 
gray capote were clearly defined. Not a drop of blood 
had flowed; the knife was still buried in the throat up 
to the handle. Furious and unreasoning with a blow 
of his fist he struck the child beside the body. 

*'Why did you do that?" stammered he, bewildered. 
Jeanlin drew himself together, dragged himself on 
his hiinds, with a cat-like curve of his meagre form, 
and his large ears, his green eyes, and his projecting 
jaws trembled and flamed from the shock of the heavy 
blow. 

" In God's name, why did you do that! " 
" I don't know. . . . I wanted to." 
This wiis his only answer. For three days he had had 
the wish. It tormented him; his head ached so there 
behind his ears, thinking of it night and day. Were 
they of any consequence, these pigs of soldiers, who 
came here to trouble the coalmen in their homes? From 
the violent speeches in the forest, the cries of devasta- 
tion and death flung across the mines, five or six words 
had impressed themselves upon him, which he repeated 
like a gamin playing at revolution. And he knew noth- 
ing more; nobody had urged him; alone the idea 
came to him like his desire to steal onions in a field. 

Etienne, shocked at this precocity of crime in the 
childish brain, with a kick drove him away as he would 
a senseless brute. He trembled lest the guard at Vo- 
reux had heard the strangling cry of the sentry, and 
cast an anxious look towards the mine each time that 
the moon shone out. But nothing stirred, and he 
crouched down, felt the hands becoming icy cold, and 
listened for the heart, silent under the capote. Nothing 
of the knife was seen but the bone handle, where the 
gallant device — the simple word " Love" — was engraved 
in black letters. His eyes went from the throat to the 
face, and suddenly he recognized the little soldier; it 
was Jules, the recruit, with whom he had chatted one 
morning. A deep pity seized him in face of these mild 
blonde features, covered with reddish stains; the large 



GEEMIÎfAL. 335 

blue eyes, widely opened, turned to the sky with that 
lixed look with wliich he had seen him scanning the 
horizon in search of his far-olï country. Where then 
was that Plogof of which he siioke? Over there, over 
there. Tiie sea moaned in the distance on this stormy 
night. Perhaps this wind, so high above, whistled 
over that land. Two women were on foot, the mother, 
the sister, holding their caps which they had taken off, 
looking out also, as if they might be able to see what 
the young soldier was doing at this hour beyond the 
leagues that separated them. They would always be 
waiting for him now. How horrible to have him kill- 
ing himself thus among poor devils, for the sake of the 
rich! 

But this body must be removed out of sight; Etienne's 
first thought was to throw it into the canal, but the 
certainty of discovery prevented him. Then his anxiety 
became extreme; time pressed; what should he do? A 
sudden inspiration came to him; if he could carry the 
body as far as Kequillart, he could bury it forever. 

" Come here,'' he said to Jeanlin. 

But the child was suspicious. 

"No, you want to beat me. And, besides, I have 
something to do. Good-night." 

And in truth he had arranged a rendezvous with 
Bebert and Lydie in a hiding-place, a hole made under 
the wood-pile at Voreux. It was a good large place to 
sleep in all night if they threw stones at the Belgians 
when they were coming down. 

"Listen,'' exclaimed Etienne. "If you don't come 
here I'll call the soldiers and they'll cut off your head." 
And as Jeanlin decided to come, he wound his hand- 
kerchief tightly round the soldier's neck, without with- 
drawing the knife, to prevent the flow of blood. 

The snow was melting; on the ground there was 
neither a red spot nor the trampling of a struggle. 

"Take him by the legs." 

Jeanlin took the legs, Etienne carried the shoulders, 
after fastening the gun at his back; and the two slowly 
descended the embankment, trying not to move the 
stones. Happily, the moon was veiled again. But, as 
they reached the bottom and were passing along the 
canal, she shone out clearly, and it was a miracle if the 



336 GERMINAL. 

guard did not see them. Without a word they hurried 
on, hindered by the shaking about of the corpse, and 
obliged to rest it on the ground every hundred metres. 
As they were turning the corner of the little Requillart 
street a noise startled them; they had only time to 
throw themselves behind a wall to avoid the patrol. 
Further on a man surprised them, but he was drunk, 
and cursed them as he passed on. They arrived at last 
at the old shaft, covered with perspiration, and so ex- 
hausted now that their teeth chattered. Etienne knew 
well that it would not be easy to take down the soldier 
by the rungs of the ladder. It was a terrible task, and 
twenty times he despaired of it. In the first place it 
was necessary that Jeanlin, from above, should let the 
corpse slide down, whilst he, hanging from the brush- 
wood, accompanied it, to help in jumping over the two 
first landing places where the rungs were broken. 
Then, at each ladder, the mauœuver had to be repeated, 
going down first .and receiving it in his arms; and thus 
over thirty ladders, two hundred and ten metres, he 
bore the burden. The gun knocked against his back; 
he would not let the child get the bit of candle which 
he had saved so carefully. What for? light would 
bother them in this narrow way. 

. Nevertheless, when they had finally arrived out of 
breath at the entry room, he sent the child for the can- 
dle; while he seated himself near the body, his heart 
beating violently. Jeanlin returned with the light, and 
it only remained to find a distant hole. Etienne con- 
sulted him, for the child had searched through these 
old works even to the cliffs where the men did not pass. 
They set out again; they dragged the body nearly a 
kilometer over winding galleries in ruins, threatening 
to give way at any moment. The roof grew lower, they 
found themselves on their knees, flattened under a 
fallen rock, which was sustained by half -broken posts. 
It made a kind of long box, where they laid the little 
soldier as in a coffin; they placed the gun at his side; 
then, with heavy blows with their heels, they finished 
the breaking up of the wood, at the risk of burying 
themselves there also. All at once, the rock split, and 
they had hardly time to scramble out on their elbows 
and knees. When Etienne looked round (unable to 



GERMIXAL. 337 

resist), the falling of the roof continued, slowly crush- 
ing the body by its enormous weight. And nothing 
remained, nothing but the heavy mass of earth. 

Jeanlin, returning home to the corner of his rogue's 
cavern, stretched himself on the hay, muttering, worn 
out with fatigue: 

'•'The brats must wait for me; I'll sleep for an hour." 

He was asleep instantly, whilst Etienne, seated on 
the wood, blew out the candle of which but a little piece 
remained. He also was worn out, but he was not 
sleepy; painful thoughts, like a nightmare, racked his 
brain. One became fixed there, torturing, wearying 
him with a question he could not answer: Avhy had he 
not struck Cheval when he had him under his knife? 
And why had that child just stabbed a soldier whose name 
he did not even know? His revolutionary creeds were 
all in confusion — the courage to kill, the right to kill. 
Was he tlien a coward? Such disgust at the shedding 
of blood tortured him with frightful doubt. Near him, 
on the hay, the boy commenced to snore, like the snor- 
ing of a satiated man, sleeping off his drunkenness, 
and it disgusted and irritated him to know him there, 
to hear him there, like a stunned and senseless brute. 

All at once, he shivered; fear came over him. A 
slight shaking, a faint sob seemed to rise from the 
depths of the earth. The image of the little soldier 
lying over there with his gun, under the rocks, flashed 
through his bram and made his hair stand on end. It 
was folly; he fought against it; all the mine seemed full 
of voices; he had to relight the candle, and only grew 
calmer when he saw the empty galleries in this pale 
light. For a quarter of an hour longer Etienne con- 
tinued the struggle, reflecting, pondering, always torn 
by the same conflict, his eyes fixed on the burning candle. 
But he shrivelled up when the candle went out, and all 
was darkness again. A shivering seized him; he would 
have touched Jeanlin to prevent his snoring so loud. 
The presence of the child became unbearable to him, he 
fled, tormented by a want of air, hurrying by the gal- 
leries, as if he had heard a ghost whispering behind him. 
Above, amidst the ruins of Requillart, he could at last 
breathe freely. Since he did not dare to kill, it was for 
him to die; and this idea of death, which had already 
17 



SùS GEKMINAi,. 

occurred to him, sprung up anew, fastening itself like a 
last hope. To die; to die for the revolution; that would 
end all, settle all his affairs, good or bad, and keep him 
from thinking any more. If the comrades attacked the 
Borains, he would be in the first ranks and have a good 
chance of a fatal blow. It was with a firm step that he 
returned to wander about Voreux. The clock at Mont- 
son had struck two; a loud noise of voices came from 
the overseers' room, where the guard at the mine were 
quartered. The disappearance of the sentry had as- 
tounded the men; they had gone to awaken the captain, 
and at last, after an examination of the place, they con- 
cluded that he had deserted. And, watching in the 
shadow, Etienne remembered the republican captain of 
whom the little soldier had spoken to him. Who knew 
if he could not be won over to the people? the troops 
would raise the butts of their muskets in the air, and 
that might be the signal for the massacre of the peas- 
antry. Another dream took possession of him; he no 
longer thought of dying, he spent hours, his feet in the 
mud, the drizzling rain of the thaw on his shoulders, 
fevered with the hope of a still possible victory. Until 
five o'clock, he awaited the Borains. Then he found 
that the company had shrewdly made them sleep at 
Voreux. The descent commenced; the day was break- 
ing, and the few strikers of the alley of the Deux- Cent- 
Quarante, posted as scouts, still hesitated to warn their 
comrades. It was he who gave them notice of the news, 
and they set off at a run, while he remained behind the 
dump on the tow-path. Six o'clock struck; the leaden 
sky paled, then was lightened by a ruddy orb, when the 
Abbe Eanvier came out from a path, with his cassock 
raised on his thin legs; every Monday he went to say 
early mass at the chapel of a convent on the other side 
of the mine. 

" Good-morning, my friend," he cried with a loud 
voice, after having scanned the young man with his 
fiery eyes. But Etienne did not reply. In the distance 
between the trussels of Voreux, he had just seen a 
woman pass, and he became uneasy and anxious, for he 
thought he had recognized Catherine. Since midnight 
Catherine had been exposed to the thaw on the roads. 
Cheval, on entering, finding her lying down, had 



GERMIifAL. 339 

brought her to her feet with a box on the ear. He 
commanded her to go out of the door instantly, if she 
did not wish to leave by the window; and weeping, 
hardly dressed, with legs bruised by kicks, she found 
herself outside. This brutal separation stunned her, 
and she had to sit down on a mile-stone in front of the 
house, looking at the front of the house, hoping that he 
would recall her; for it was not possible — he was watch- 
ing her, he would tell her to come up again when he 
saw her trembling thus, abandoned, without a soul to 
take her in. At length, at the end of two hours, she 
came to a decision, perishing with cold like a dog 
thrown out into t!ie street. She left Montson, retraced 
her steps, not daring either to call from the pavement 
or to knock at the door. At last she went off on the 
paved highway with the vague idea of returning to the 
alley, to her parents. But when she arrived there such 
shame took possession of her that she ran the length of 
the gardens from fear of being seen by someone in 
spite of their heavy sleep behind the closed blinds. 
And she wandered about, trembling at the slightest 
noise, believing that they were going to take her up as 
a bad woman and conduct her to that bad house at 
Marchiennes, the horror of which had haunted her like 
a nightmare for months. Twice she stumbled against 
the Voreux, frightened at the loud voices of the guard, 
ran off out of breath, now and then looking back to see 
that she was not pursued. The Eequillart lane was 
always full of drunken men; she returned there, not- 
withstanding, in the unconscious hope of finding him 
whom she had repulsed a few hours before. If he were 
there he would defend her; and it was he, perhaps, 
that she sought in bewilderment through th^ darkness, 
without knowing herself what anguish it was that thus 
actuated her. 

Cheval was to go down to Yoreux at four o'clock. 
This thought brought Catherine back towards the mine. 
She would see him, but she knew it would be useless to 
speak to him; all was finished between them. There 
was no work going on at Jean- Bart, and Cheval had 
told her that he would strangle her if she recommenced 
work at Voreux, where he feared she would compromise 
him. Then, what was to be done? Go elsewhere, starve 



340 GERMINAL. 

with luingef, give np under the cnfFs of all the men 
passing by? She dragged lierself along, staggering in 
the ruts, her legs shaking and covered with mud. The 
thaw now rolled tln-ough the roads in a muddy stream; 
she was almost drowned in it, walking on always, not 
daring to look for a stone to sit down upon. Daylight 
came, and slie had just recognized Cheval's back as he 
turned to enter the mine, when she perceived Lydie and 
Bebert putting their noses out of their hiding-place 
under the wood-pile. They had stayed there in vain, 
without daring to return home, from the moment 
Jeanlin gave the order to wait for him, and, while the 
latter slept at Eequillart in the heavy stupor arising 
from the murder, the two children had their arms round 
each other to keep warm. The wind passed between the 
sticks of chestnut and oak, clashing as in the center of 
a wood-cutter's hut. Lydie did not dare to speak aloud 
of her sufferings, like a beaten little woman, any more 
than Bebert had the courage to complain of the cuffs he 
received from the captain. But at last the latter abused 
them too much, cuffed harder, risked breaking their 
bones in foolish raids, and then refused them any share 
in the spoils; and their hearts swelled in revolt. They 
had ended by embracing each other, in si)ite of his pro- 
hibition, willing to receive the box on the ear from an 
invisible hand with which he menaced them; they con- 
tinued kissing each other for a long time without 
thinking of anything else, concentrating in this caress 
all their long- restrained love, all that they had endured 
of martyrdom and suffering. During the whole night 
they had thus kept themselves warm, so happy at the 
bottom of this hole that they could not remember ever 
having been more so, even at St. Barbe, where they ate 
fritters and drank wine. 

A bugle call made Catherine shiver. She raised her- 
self up and saw the guard at Voreux taking their arms. 
Etienne arrived running. Bebert and Lydie, with one 
spring, jumped out of their hiding place; and over there, 
in the growing daylight a band of men and women were 
coming down the alley with excited and angry gestures. 



GEEMINAL. 341 



CHAPTER XXXIV. 

They had just barricaded all the openings to the 
Voreux; and the twenty-five soldiers, barred the only 
door remaining free, that which led to the receiver's 
utiice, by the narrow staircase on which the overseers' 
room and the waiting room opened. The captain had 
ranged them in two filfs against the brick wall, so that 
they could not be attacked from behind. At first the 
band of miners, which had come dovt'n the alley, re- 
mained at a distance. They numbered thirt}^ at the 
most; they consulted with violent and confused words. 
La Maheu, the first on the ground, with uncombed 
hair under a handkerchief knotted in haste, holding 
Estelle still asleep in her arms, repeating in a feverish 
voice, "Let no one go in, and let no one go out. AVe 
must crush them all in there!" 

Maheu approved, just as the pere Moque arrived from 
Eequillart. They wished to prevent him from passing. 
But he disputed the point; he said his horses eat their 
oats all the same and did not care for the revolution; 
besides, there was a dead horse and they were expecting 
him to take it away. Etienne relieved the old groom, 
and the soldiers allowed him to ascend to the shaft. A 
quarter of an hour later, as the band of strikers, gradu- 
ally grown larger, became threatening, a large door 
opened on the ground floor; men appeared carrying the 
dead animal, a wretched looking bundle still tied up 
with ropes, which they abandoned in the midst of the 
melting masses of snow. The surprise was such that 
they did not prevent them from re-entering and barri- 
cading the door again. All had recognized the horse, 
with his head bent and stiff against his flank; whispers 
flew round. 

*' It's Trompette, isn't it? It's Trompette." 

It was Trompette, indeed. Since his descent he 
could never become acclimatized. He remained dull, 
without interest in the work, as if tortured with a long- 
ing for the light. In vain did Bataille, the senior of 
the mine, kindly rub against his sides and bite his neck 
to impart to him a little of the patience acquired by his 



342 GERMIXAL. 

ten years in the depths. These caresses increased his 
mehmcholy, his skin shivered under the confidences of 
the comrade grown old in the darkness, and the two, 
when the}'' met and snorted together, seemed to be 
himenting, the okl one tliat he could not remember, the 
young one that he could not forget. At the stable, with 
neighboring mangers, they ate with drooping heads, 
whispering through their nostrils, exchanging tiieir con- 
stant dream of daylight, of visions of green herbage, of 
white roads, of yellow lights without end. Then, one 
morning, when Trompette lay dying on his litter. 
Bataille began to smell him despairingly with short 
snifflings resembling sobs. He felt himself growing 
cold. The mine had robbed him of his last joy, this 
friend fallen from above, redolent of sweet odors, re- 
calling to Jiim his youth in the open air. And he broke 
his tether neighing with fright on the night that he 
perceived the other moved no more. 

Moque had not failed to give notice to the head over- 
seer eight days ago. But a sick horse was not worth 
thinking about in such times as thesel The adminis- 
tration did not much like changing horses. Now, at 
least he must be taken out. The groom had spent an 
hour with two men the evening before tying up Trom- 
pette, Bataille was harnassed to carry him to the shaft. 
Slowly the old horse pulled, dragging the dead comrade 
through such a narrow gallery that he had to tug at it 
at the risk of scratching him; and, with a look of ex- 
haustion, harassed, shaking his head, he listened to the 
long dragging of that mass awaited at the knacker's. 

In the'shaft room they forgot him as soon as they had 
unharnessed him; with 'his mournful eye he watched 
the preparations for mounting, the carcass pushed on 
crossbars above the water sump, the cord attached 
under the cage. At last the loaders gave the signal for 
flesh freight; he raised his neck to see him leave, at 
first slowly, then immediately lost in darkness, swept 
away forever above this black hole, then he remained 
with his neck stretched out, the wandering memory of 
the animal perhaps reminding him of the things up 
there, of the mill of his youth on the banks of the 
Scarpe, of the large lamp traversing the air. But it 
was ended; the comrade would see nothing more; he 



GERMINAL. 343 

himself wonlcl be tied up in a pitiful bundle on the day 
when he went up there again. His feet began to 
tremble, the strong air which came from the far-off 
country stifled him; and he seemed as if intoxicated 
when he returned heavily to the stable. 

On the flagging the strikers remained gloomily before 
Trompette's corpse. A woman said in an undertone, 
" One man more — we can go down if we choose." 

But another crowd was coming from the alley, and 
Levaque, who marched at the head, followed by la 
Le vaque and Bouteloup, cried: 

" Death to the Borains ! No strangers here! To the 
death! To the death!" 

All were rushing on, Etienne must stop them. He 
had approached the captain, a tall, slight-looking young 
man, hardly twenty-eight years old, with an air of des- 
perate resolution; and he explained to him the state of 
affairs, endeavoring to win him over, and watching the 
effect of his words. Why risk a useless massacre? Was 
not justice on the side of the miners? They were all 
brothers, and ought to understand one another? At the 
word republic the captain made a nervous gesture. 
With military stiffness he said abruptly: 

"Leave! Do not force me to do my duty." 

Three times Etienne renewed his explanations. His 
comrades at his back were grumbling. The rumor ran 
that M. Hennebeau was at the mine, and there was a talk 
of putting him down by the neck to see if he would bring 
down his coal himself. But the rumor was false; only 
Megrel and Danseart were there, both showing them- 
selves for an instant at a window of the receiver's room; 
the superintendent kej)t in the background, disheart- 
ened, since his adventure with la Pierronne; whilst the 
engineer boldly scanned the crowd with his bright little 
eyes, smiling with the scoflSng contempt with which he 
looked on men and things. Threatening shouts arose, 
and they disappeared; and in their place, only the 
blonde face of Jouvarine was visible. He had just been 
at work, and he came there to have a glance when he 
could leave the engine for a few seconds. AVith an air 
of calmness, mute, with the fixed idea set in the depths 
of his clear eyes, he had not given up for a single day 



344 TERMINAL. 

the plan he had laid from the commencement of the 
strike. 

"Leave!" repeated the captain, in loud tones. '' I 
have nothing to hear; I am ordered to guard the shaft; 
I will guard it. And don't push against my men, 
or Pll make you draw back." 

In spite of the firmness of his voice, he paled with in- 
creasing anxiety at the sight of the constantly swelling 
crowd of miners. He was to be relieved at noon, and, 
fearing that he could not hold out till then, he had just 
sent a boy from the mines to Montsou, asking for rein- 
forcements. 

Shouts replied to him: 

" Death to the strangers! Death to the Borains! We 
are the masters here." 

Etienne retreated in despair. It was the end; no- 
thing remained but to fight and to die. And he ceased 
to restrain his comrades; the band pressed on as far 
as the little troop. They numbered nearly four 
hundred already; the neighboring alleys were emptying 
themselves, the men arriving at racing speed. All 
uttered the same cry, Maheu and Levaque repeating 
furiously to the soldiers: 

*' Be off ! we have nothing against you; be off !" 

"This does not concern you," said la Maheu, 
"Let us settle our own affairs." 

And behind her, la Levaque added more violently: 

"Must we cut you to get past? We beg you to break 
up your camp." 

Even the shrill voice of Lydie, who, with Bebert, had 
forced herself into the thickest of the crowd, was heard, 
saying in a sharp tone: 

"Look at the fools!" 

Catherine, a few steps off, looked and listened as if 
stupefied by this fresh violence, in the midst of which 
she had fallen. Had she not suffered too much already? 
What fault had she committed that misfortune left her 
no rest? Even last evening she knew nothing of the 
wrath of the strikers. She thought that when one 
already had her share of blows, it was useless to seek for 
more; and at this hour her heart swelled with a desire 
to hate something. She remembered what Etienne had 
told her formerly in the evenings; she tried to hear what 



GEKMIXAL. 345 

he was saying now to the soldiers. He spoke to them as 
comrades, he reminded them that they also were of the 
people, that they ought to join with them against those 
who took advantage of their wretchedness. 

But in the crowd there was a sudden movement, and 
an old woman struggled forward. It was Brule, friglit- 
fully thin, neck and arms uncovered, running in such 
haste that the flying locks of gray hair blinded her. 

''Ah! my God, I'm here," she stammered, out of 
breath. "That traitor Pierron had me shut up in the 
cellar." And without waiting she attacked the troops, 
her black mouth filled with imprecations. 

*'Mob of rascals! mob of sots! who lick the boots of 
your superiors, you've courage only against the poor!" 

Then the others joined her in a stream of insults. A 
few still cried; "Long live the soldiers! to the shaft 
with the officer!" But soon there was but one cry: 
"Down with the red pantaloons!" 

The men v/ho had listened impassively, with faces 
dumb and motionless, to the appeals to fraternity, the 
friendly attempts at seduction, preserved the same 
passive stiffness under this hail of insults. Behind them 
the captain had drawn his sword, and as the crowd 
pressed them more and more, threatening to crush them 
against the wall, he commanded them to charge 
bayonets. They obeyed; a double row of steel points 
were lowered before the breasts of the strikers. 

" Ah! the devils," roared old Brule, drawing back. 

Already all were returning, in exalted defiance of 
death. Women rushed on with the men, la Maheu 
and la Levaque saying: 

"Do kill us! do kill us, then! We want our rights." 

At the risk of cutting himself, Levaque had seized 
with both hands a cluster of bayonets, three bayonets, 
which he shook and dragged towards him, to snatch 
them away; he twisted them, with strength doubled by 
his anger, while Bouteloup, at one side, Vv^eary of fol- 
lowing this comrade, looked on calmly. 

"Here!" said Maheu. " Here, if you're good fellows!" 
and he opened his vest, pushing aside his shirt, show- 
ing his naked breast, the flesh hairy and tatooed with 
coal. He pushed against the points, he compelled them 
to draw back, terrible with his firmness and bravery. 



346 GERMINAL. 

One of them pricked his chest; he rejoiced at it and 
tried to have it pierce deeper so as to hear his ribs 
crack. 

" Cowards, you dare not. . . . There are ten 
thousand behind us. Yes, you can kill us, there will 
be ten thousand more to kill still.'' 

The position of the soldiers was becoming critical, 
for they had been strictly forbidden by their captain lo 
use their arms only in the last extremity. And how 
were those enraged creatures there to be prevented 
from spitting themselves? On the other side, the space 
constantly diminished, they found themselves now 
driven against the wall without the possibility of re- 
treating any more. Their little squad, a mere handful 
of men, in front of the swelling tide of the miners, held 
their own notwithstanding, executing with coolness 
the brief orders issued by the captain. He, with clear 
eyes and lips nervously pressed together, had but one 
fear, that of seeing them exasperated at last by the 
insults. Already, a young sergeant, a lean little fellow, 
whose mustache of four hairs bristled, worked his eye- 
lids in an uneasy manner. Near him an old soldier, 
tanned like leather by twenty campaigns, had turned 
pale when he saw his bayonet twisted like a straw. 
Another, a recruit doubtless, fresh from labor, turned 
red every time he heard them called rascals and de- 
bauchees. And the violence did not cease, extended 
fists, abominable words, peltings, menaces, and accusa- 
tions were flung full in the face. It needed all the 
strength of discipline to hold them thus, with mute 
faces, in the haughty and sad silence of military orders. 
A collision appeared unavoidable, when the overseer, 
Richomme, was suddenly seen to come out behind the 
troops, violently moving he spoke aloud: 

" My God, what a stupid end this is! We must not 
permit such nonsense." 

ne threw himself between the bayonets and the 
miners. 

" Comrades, listen to me. . . . You know that I 
am an old w^orkman, and that I have never ceased to be 
one of you. Well, in God's name, I promise you that if 
you are not treated justly, it is I who will tell the chiefs 
the truth. . . . But this is too much, it does no

good slinging bad words at these worthy folks, and 
wanting to have a hole made in one's body." 

They listened, they hesitated, unfortunately, the sharp 
profile of little Negrel reappeared. Doubtless he feared 
that he would be accused of sending an overseer instead 
of risking himself; and he tried to speak. But his voice 
was lost in the midst of such a frightful tumult that he 
had to leave the window, after having merely shrugged 
his shoulders. From that time it was in vain that 
Eichomme entreated them in his name, repeating that 
among comrades such things should be ])assed over; he 
was pushed back, he was suspected. But he was de- 
termined; he remained in the midst of them repeating: 

*'In God's name! they may break my head, but I 
won^t let you go, so long as yoti are such fools." 

Etienne, whom he begged to aid him in making them 
listen to reason, felt his impotence. It was too late, 
they now numbered more than five hundred. And there 
were not only the maddened ones collected to drive out 
the Borains; there were those drawn by curiosity, 
jokers who amused themselves watching the conflict. 
In the middle of the group at a little distance Zacharie 
and Philomêne looked on as at a play, so quiet that they 
had brought the two children, Achille and Desiree, 
Another company arrived from Requillart with Mouqiiet 
and la Mouquette; he went immediately to his friend 
Zacharie, tapping him on the shoulder with a malicious 
laugh, whilst she, with much energy, threw herself into 
the foremost rank of the rioters. Meanwhile the cap- 
tain turned unceasingly toward the Montson road. The 
reinforcements asked for did not arrive; his twenty-five 
men could hold out no longer. At length he thought 
he would startle the crowd and he gave the command to 
load the guns. The soldiers obeyed the order, but the 
excitement increased, a fresh tumult arose of bragging 
and mockery. "Look at these lazy creatures! they are 
going oS to the target,'"' sneered the women, la Brule, 
la Levaque and the others. 

La Maheu, her breast covered by the little body of 
Estelle, who had waked up and was crying, approached 
so near that the sergeant asked her what she was there 
for, and with that poor little brat. 



348 GERMINAL. 

"What business is it of yours?" she replied. "Fire, 
if you dare." 

The men shook their heads contemptuously. No one 
thought of firing on them. 

"They have no balls in their cartridges," said 
Levaque. 

"Are we Cossacks? " cried Maheu, exasperated. " My 
God! we don't fire on Frenchmen. 

Others exclaimed that when they made the campaign 
in the Crimea they were not afraid of lead. And all 
continued toj)ush against the guns. If a discharge had 
taken place at this monaent it would have mowed down 
the crowd. In the first rank laMouquette was choking 
herself with fury, thinking that the red pantaloons 
wished to fire on the women. She had spit out at them 
all the most injurious and the basest insults she could 
possibly think of, and then proceeding to an action so 
beastly outrageous that a storm of laughter followed. 
All the jokers as well as the madmen now hooted at the 
soldiers as if they saw them covered with filth. Cather- 
ine only, on one side standing on the old wood, remained 
mute, the blood rising to her throat, filled with the 
hatred whose rising heat she felt. Bnt a hustling took 
place. To calm the excitement of the soldiers the cap- 
tain decided to take some prisoners. With a le;ip 
Mouquette escaped by throwing herself between the legs 
of her comrades. Three miners, Levaque and two 
others, were seized in the group of the most violent and 
kept in sight at the back of the overseers' room. 

From above Megrel and Danseart cried tc the captain 
to come in again, to shut himself up with them; but he 
would not. He knew that these buildings, the doors 
without locks, would be carried by assault, and that he 
would then have the mortification of being disarmed. 
Already his little troop grumbled impatiently; they could 
not beat a retreat before these wretches in sabots. Once 
more the twenty-five, pressed against the wall, Avith 
loaded guns faced the mob. At first there was a back- 
v/ard movement, an uneasy silence. The strikers were 
astonished at this display of strength. Then a loud cry 
rose, demanding the prisoners and their immediate 
liberation. Some voices exchiimed that they were being 
strangled in there. And without any concerted plan. 



GEKAIIÎTAL. 349 

moved by one impulse, by the same thirst for revenge, 
all ran to a neighboring pile of bricks, brick for which 
the marly soil furnished the clay, and which were baked 
on the spot. The children carried them one by one, the 
v&gt;'omen filled their skirts with them. Soon each one had 
munitions at his feet, and the battle of stones com- 
menced. It was Brule who landed the first. She broke 
the bricks across her thin knee, and with her right hand 
and left she threw the two pieces. La Levaque shrugged 
her shoulders, so large, so soft; she had to approacli to 
take part in the fray, in spite of the entreaties of 
Bouteloup, who was drawing her back in the hope of 
getting her away, now that the husband was invisible. 

All was excitement. Mouquette, longing for blood, 
weary of breaking bricks on her fat legs, ended by 
flinging them whole. The gamins themselves joined 
the fight. Bebert showed Lydie how to throw them 
under the elbow. It was a hail-storm, the hail- stones 
larger than fists, and the heavy crashing was heard afar. 
Suddenly, in the midst of these furies, Catherine was 
seen, her two arms raised in the air, also brandishing 
pieces of brick, flinging them with all the strength 
of her little arms. She could not tell why, but 
she was stifled, she longed to kill the whole world. 
Wouldn't it soon be ended, this life of wretchedness? 
She had had enough of it, of being cuffed and driven 
out by her man, of roaming about thus, like a dog lost 
m the muddy roads, without even being able to ask her 
father for a dinner, who had a way of swallowing his 
tongue like herself. And it was never better that she 
could remember. So she broke bricks and threw them 
before her with the sole idea of making a sweep of 
everything, her eyes so blinded with blood that she did 
not even see whose j iws she cracked. 

Eiienue, who remained in front of the soldiers, nar- 
rowly escaped having his skull split in two; his ear 
swelled, he turned and shivered on finding that the 
brick v/as flung by the nervous hands of Catherine; and 
at the risk of being killed he did not move off, but 
looked at her. Many others thus forgot themselves 
tliere, in the excitement of the fight with arms swing- 
ing. Moquet marked the blov/s with light cries, as if 
he were witnessing a game at a public house. 



350 GERMINAL. 

'^Oh! that one was well aimed! that other has no 
chance!" He pushed Zacharie with his elbow, who 
was quarreling with Philomêne, because he had boxed 
Achille and Desiree, refusing to take them on his back 
that they might see. There was a crowd of spectators 
gathered in tiie distance along the road as far as the 
dump. And at the top of the hill, at the entrance of 
the valley, old Bonnemort had just appeared, drag- 
ging himself with a cane, motionless now, straight 
against the leaden colored sky. As soon as the first 
bricks were thrown the overseer, Eichomme, had planted 
himself again between the soldiers and the miners. He 
entreated the one, he exhorted the other, regardless of 
danger, and in such despair that large tears fan from 
his eyes. His words could not be heard in the tumult, 
they could only see the trembling of his large gray 
mustaches. A moment he opened his arms; doubtless 
it was a menace to his comrades that he would not stir, 
that he would await a blow there if they continued to 
stone the troop. 

But the hail of bricks grew thicker, the men follow- 
ing the example of the women. 

La Maheu .suddenly perceived that Maheu remained 
behind. His hands were empty, he was looking on, 
very pale. Then she grew enraged with him: 

"Say, what's the matter with you? . . . Are 
you a coward? Are you going to let them take your 
comrades to prison? . . . Ah! if I hadn't this child, 
you would see!" 

Estelle, who was clinging round her neck and roar- 
ing, prevented her from joining Brule and the others. 
And as Maheu did not appear to hear her, with her foot 
she pushed some bricks against his legs. 

"In God's name, will you take that? Must I spit in 
your face before everyone to give you courage? " 

Then, reddening, he broke the bricks and flung them. 
She urged him on, stunned him, uttering death cries 
behind him, suffocating the little one against her throat 
in her clenched arms; he kept advancing and soon 
found himself facing the guns. Under this shower of 
stones, the little troop was disappearing. Fortunately, 
nearly all struck too high; the wall was shattered by 
them. What was to be done? The idea of going in 



GERMIJSTAL. 351 

again, of turning his back, flushed the captain's pale 
face for an instant; but it was no longer possible; they 
would be cut to pieces at the slightest movement. A 
brick had just struck the visor of his kepi; drops of 
blood ran from his forehead. Several of his men were 
already wounded, and he felt they were getting beyond 
his control from the ungovernable instinct of personal 
defense when the orders of the chief are no longer 
obeyed. The little sergeant had uttered a cry to God! 
his right shoulder half disjointed, the flesh bruised by a 
heavy crash like the blow of the beetle in a laundry. 
Three times already the recruit had been scratched; his 
right hand was bleeding, a bruise tortured his right 
knee. Were they to remain in this position any longer? 
Near him the old Cheveonne was biting his lips in a last 
struggle for patience, when a stone rebounded and 
struck him in the stomach; his tanned cheeks turned 
green, his gun shook and was stretched out at the end 
of his thin arms. Twice the captain was on the point 
of ordering them to fire. Anguish choked him; the 
internal combat of a few seconds was confusing his 
ideas of duty; all his creeds as a man and as a soldier. 
The hail of bricks redoubled, and he was opening his 
mouth to give the order to "Fire!" when the guns 
were discharged themselves — three shots at first, then 
five, then the roll of a volley, then a single shot, a long 
time after in the utter silence. A stupor followed; they 
had fired, the gaping crowd remained motionless, not 
yet believing it. But piercing screams arose, whilst the 
trumpet sounded the order to cease firing. A crazy 
panic followed, a race like that of cattle fired upon, lost 
in the flight throligh the mud. 

Bebert and Lydie had fallen, one on the top of the 
other, at the first three shots; the little girl struck in the 
face, the little boy under the left shoulder. She, thun- 
derstruck, did not move again; but he, stirring, siezed 
her with both hands in the convulsions of death; as if he 
wished to embrace her again as he had embraced her at 
the bottom of the dark hiding-place, where they had 
JList passed their last night. And Jeanlin, just arrived 
at a run from Eequillart bloated with sleep, jumping 
in the midst of the smoke, saw him embrace his little 
wife and die. 



352 GERMINAL. 

The other five shots had hiid low Brule and the over- 
seer, Richomme, struck in the back at the moment he 
was supplicating his comrades, he had fallen on his 
knees; and slipping on his hip, he gave the death rattle 
on the ground, his eyes filled with the tears he had 
shed. The old woman, with open throat had been 
stricken down all stiff and cracking like a fagot of dead 
wood, her last oath strangled by the spouting blood. 
But then the firing of the volley swept the ground, 
mowing down, at a hundred paces, the group of curiosi- 
ty seekers who were laughing at the battle. A ball 
entered Mouquet's mouth, knocking him over, shattei'ed, 
at the feet of Zacharie and Philomêne, whose two brats 
were covered with red drops. At the same instant Mo- 
quette received two balls in her stomach. She had 
seen the soldiers shoulder arms; she had thrown her- 
self, by the instinctive movement of a good girl, before 
Catherine, calling out to her to take care, and she 
uttered a great cry, stretched on her back, overthrown 
by the shock. Etienne ran to her and wished to raise 
her and carry her away, but with a gesture she said 
that she was finished. Then there was a rattling in 
her throat, without her ceasing to smile at both of them, 
as if happy to see them together now that she was 
going away. 

All seemed ended, the tempest of the balls had spent 
itself in the distance as far as the fronts of the alley, 
when the last shot was fired, alone after the others. 

Maheu, struck full in the heart, turned round and 
fell with his face in a pool of water, black with coal. 
Stupefied, la Maheu stooped down: 

"Ah! my old man, get up. It's nothing, tell me." 
Her hands encumbered by Estelle, she had to put her 
under her arm to turn her husband's head. 

'•Do speak ! Where are you hurt?" His eyes were 
glassy and vacant, the mouth foaming with a bloody 
froth. She understood he was dead. Then she re- 
mained seated in the dirt, her child under her arm like 
a bundle, looking at her old man with an air of stupe- 
faction. 

The mine was free. With a nervous gesture, the 
captain had taken off and then replaced his kepi cut by 
a stone, and he maintained his pale stiffness in facing 



GEKMINAL. 353 

the disaster of his life; whilst his men, with dumb faces, 
reloaded their guns. The terrified faces of Megrel and 
Dauseart appeared at the window of the receiver's room. 
Jouvarine was behind them, his forehead crossed by a 
large wrinkle, as if the bar of his fixed idea had menac- 
ingly stamped itself there. On the other side of the 
horizon, on the edge of the plain, Bonnemort had not 
stirred, supported by one hand on his cane, the other 
raised to his eyebrows to see better below, the throttling 
of his people. The wounded moaned, the dead grew 
cold in the watery mud of the thaw, in puddles here 
and there black as ink from the coal which reappeared 
under the fragments soiled by the snow. And among 
these corpses of men, all small, with a look of lean 
misery, lay the carcass of Trompette, a heap of dead 
flesh, immense and pitiful. Etienne had not been killed. 
He was still waiting when a ringing voice made him 
turn his head. It was the Abbe Kanvier, returning 
from saying mass, and who, with both arms in the air, 
with prophetic fury, invoked the wrath of God on the 
assassins. He announced the era of justice, the ap- 
proaching extermination of the peasantry by fire from 
heaven, since they filled up the measure of their sins 
by massacering the laborers and the disinherited of 
this world. 



CHAPTER XXXV. 



The firing at Montson had reverberated at Paris with 
a formidable echo. For four days all the opposition 
journals were indignant at it, displaying on the first 
sheet all its a'rocities; twenty-five wounded, fourteen 
dead, of whom two were children and three women; and 
there were prisoners also. Levaque had become a sort 
of hero; they credited with a reply to the police magis- 
trate of antique simplicity. The empire, struck at thus 
boldly by these few balls, which the logic of facts alone 
had drawn from the guns, affected the calmness of the 
all-powerful, without taking any notice of the grave 
nature of its wound. It was only an unfortunate colli- 
sion, something lost over there in that black country, 
so far off from the Parisian pave which ruled opinion. 
23 



354 GERMINAL. 

It would soon be forgotten, the company had received 
official orders to stifle the matter and to end the strike, 
whose irritating length endangered society. Therefore, 
on Wednesday morning, three of the managers were 
seen to disembark at Montson. The little town, sick 
at heart, not having dared thus far to rejoice aloud at 
the massacre, drew breath and tasted the joy of safety. 

And now the day was fine, the sun clear, one of those 
first warm days of February which bring the lilacs into 
bloom. All the blinds of the owner's house had been 
taken down, the vast building seemed to revive; and 
good news issued from it; it was said that these gentle- 
men, affected by the catastrophe, hurried here to open 
their paternal arms to those who had not been slaugh- 
tered in the alley. Now that the blow had been given, 
a little harder doubtless than they had wished, they 
displayed great activity in their role as saviours, they 
took tardy and excellent measures. In the first place 
they dismissed the Borains, making a great deal of this 
extreme concession to their workmen. Then they put 
an end to the occupation of the mines by the military, 
which the crushed strikers no longer threatened; and it 
was they also who insured silence on the subject of the 
disappearance of the sentry of Voreux; the country had 
been ransacked v/ithout finding either his body or his 
gun; it was decided to write him down deserter; though 
they ended by suspecting a crime. 

In all things they endeavored to extenuate the past, 
to soften its gravity, uneasy now from fear of the mor- 
row, thinking it dangerous to acknowledge the irresis- 
tible savageness of a mob set loose across the rotten 
timber work of the old world. And besides, this work 
of pacification did not prevent a profitable management 
of affairs purely administrative; for Deneulin had been 
seen to return to the owner's house, where he met M. 
Hennebeau. Negotiations were resumed for the pur- 
chase of Vandame; it was even said that he was going 
to accept the absurd offers of these gentlemen, being 
accused and threatened with comj)lete ruin. But that 
which especially excited the country was the large 
yellow handbills which the managers had pasted in 
great numbers on the walls. They contained these few 
lines in very large letters: 



GERMIN-AL. 355 

'' Workmen of Montson, we do not wish that the 
errors, of which you have seen the sad consequences 
during the last few days, should deprive steady and 
willing workmen of the means of existence. On Mon- 
day morning, therefore, we will re-open all the mines, 
and when work is resumed we will carefully and kindly 
examine the situations which may require amelioration. 
In short, we will do all that it is just and possible to 
do." In the course of one morning, the ten thousand 
coalmen of Montson defiled before these handbills. Not 
one spoke, many shook their heads, others went off, with 
tlieir slow step, without the moving of a feature in their 
faces. 

Thus far, the alley of the Deux-Cents-Quarante had 
persisted in their savage resistance. It seemed as if the 
blood of the comrades which had reddened the mud of 
the mines had barred the road to the others. Hardly a 
dozen had gone down again; Pierron, and the hypocrites 
of his stani}), at whom they looked gloomily, going and 
returning, without a gesture or a menace. Thus the 
handbill posted on the church was received with gloomy 
distrust; nothing was said of the discharges sent in; 
did the company refuse to take those men back? and 
the fear of reprisals, the fraternal idea of protesting 
against the dismissal of the most compromised, made 
thom headstrong again. It was equivocal; they must 
see; they would return to the shafts when these gentle- 
men were good enough to explain themselves frankly. 

The low houses were crushed in gloomy silence; even 
hunger was nothing now; all could die, since death by 
violence had passed over the roofs. But one house 
among the others, that of the ]\Iaheus, remained darker 
and more silent than all in the depth of its mourning. 
Since she had accompanied her husband to the cemetery, 
la Maheu had not opened her mouth. Life went on 
around her without any notice. After the battle she had 
allowed Etienne to bring Catherine home with them, 
muddy, half dead; and, as she undressed her, she 
imagined for an instant tjjat it was her daughter coming 
back to her wounded. But she did not speak to 
Catherine any more than she did to Etienne. He again 
slept with Jeanlin, at the risk of being arrested, seized 
with such a repugnance at the idea of returning to the 



356 GERMINAL. 

darkness of Eequillart that he preferred a prison. 
A shiver came over him, a horror of niglit after all these 
deaths, an unacknowledged fear of the little soldier 
sleeping over there under the rocks. Besides, he came 
to dream of the prison as a refuge in the midst of the 
torment of his defeat; but he was unmolested, and he 
dragged on through long, miserable hours, not knowing 
what to do with himself. 

At times only la Maheu looked at them both, him 
and her daughter, with an air of bitterness, as if asking 
what they v/ere doing at her house. Life had been 
resumed; all snored together, Bonnemort alone ocupy- 
ing the old bed of the two brats who slept with 
Catherine, now that poor Alzire was no longer there to 
drive her hump into her big sister's sides. And it was 
above all when the mother went to lie down at night 
that she felt the void in the house in the coldness of 
abed become so large. In vain she took Estelle to fill up 
the vacancy; nothing could do it, and she cried silently 
for hours together. Tlien the days ran on again as 
formerly; never any bread, without, however, having the 
chance of starving; bits picked up here and there, 
which did the wretched creatures the ill turn of keeping 
them alive. Her life had not changed, but she was 
without her husband. 

On the afternoon of the fifth day, Etienne, driven to 
desperation by the sight of this silent woman, preferred 
to go out, and walked slowly through the paved street 
of the alley. This inaction which weighed upon him 
urged him to incessant walking, his arms swinging, his 
head empty, tortured by the same thought. He had 
been going and coming in this manner for half an hour, 
when he became aware, through an increased feeling of 
uneasiness, that the comrades were coming to the doors 
to look at him. The last shred of his popularity had 
been blown away at the catastrophe of Voreux; he 
could no longer pass at this hour without encountering 
hostile looks. He raised his head, threatening men 
were there, and women, drawing aside the little window 
curtains, and under the still unspoken accusations un- 
der the restrained wrath of these large eyes, grown 
larger with hunger and tears, he became awkward and 
forgot how to walk. And still, behind him, the silent 



GERMINAL. 357 

wrath increased. Such a fear possessed him of hearing 
the whole alley rush out to proclaim his misery, that 
he re-entered, shuddering. 

But at the Maheus, the scene which awaited him 
completed his overthrow. Old Bonuemort was there, a 
fixture in his chair since the two neighbors had been 
obliged to bring him in on the day of the butchery, 
having found him on the ground, his cane in pieces, 
struck down like an old tree by a thunder-bolt. And 
while Lenore and Henri, to cheat their hunger, scraped 
with a stunning noise an old saucepan, in which cab- 
bages had been boiled the previous evening, la Maheu, 
standing up, after having placed Estelle on the table, 
was threatening with her fist, Catherine, very pale: 

"Repeat that! Repeat what you have just been 
saying!" 

Catherine had expressed her intention of returning 
to the Voreux. The idea of not earning her bread, of 
being thus tolerated at her mother's like a beast, en- 
cumbering and useless, became each day more intolera- 
ble to her; and but for the fear of receiving a severe 
blow from Cheval if she found him at the mine, she 
would have gone down there on Tuesday. She replied, 
stammeringly: 

"What do you want? We can't live without doing 
anything. We should have bread at least." 

La Maheu interrupted her: 

"Listen! the first of you that works I'll strangle. 
Ah! no, it would be too much to kill the father and 
then continue to work the children! That's enough, 
I'd rather see you all carried out between four planks 
like him who has gone already." 

And furiously her long silence broke iu a torrent of 
words. Much they would gain from Catherine's earn- 
ings! hardly thirty sous, to which might be added 
twenty sous if the chiefs should be good enough to find 
employment for that little brigand Jeanlin, who only 
came in now in the evening to go to bed. Fifty sous, 
and seven mouths to feed ! The brats were not yet g(wd 
for anything but to swallow soup. As to the grand- 
father, he must have cracked something in his brain 
when he fell, for he seemed imbecile; or perhaps he 



358 GERMINAL. 

had been thus affected from seeing the soldiers fire on 
his comrades. 

" Isn't it so, old man? they've finished you at last. 
Your fist may be heavy still, but you're broken to 
pieces." 

Bonnemort looked at her with his dim eyes, without 
appearing to understand. He remained for hours at a 
time staring vacantly, only retaining sufficient intelli- 
gence to spit into a plate filled with ashes, placed at his 
side for the sake of cleanliness. 

''And they have not settled about his pension !" she 
continued, "and I'm certain they'll refuse it on account 
of our sentiments. No! I tell you we've had enough of 
such people." 

" Nevertheless," Catherine ventured to say, ''they 
promise on the handbill. . . ." 

"Will you hold your tongue, with your handbill! 
It's only a little more bird-lime to catch us and eat us 
up. They can be very mild now that they've put holes 
through us." 

"But then, mamma, wliere shall we go? They won't 
keep us in the alley, you may be sure." 

La Maheu gesticulated friglitfully. Where would 
they go? She couldn't tell, she avoided thinking of it, 
it made her crazy. They would go away somewhere, 
anywhere. And as the scraping of the saucepan was 
becoming unbearable, slie fell upon Lenore and Henri 
and cuffed them. The row was heightened by the fall- 
ing of Estelle, who had dragged herself on all fours 
along the table. The mother silenced her with a slap: 
what a blessing if the fall had killed her! She spoke 
of Alzire, and wished the others could be as lucky. 
Then suddenly she broke into heavy sobs, leaning her 
head against the wall. Etienne, standing, had not 
dared to intervene; he was of no account now in the 
house; even the children withdrew from him with dis- 
trust. Thus he had an air of embarrassment. But the 
tears of this unfortunate mother touched his heart and 
he murmured: 

"Come, come, cheer up! We'll try and get out of 
this." 

She did not appear to hear him.; she was now lament- 
ing in alow and continuous strain: 



GEEMIISTAL. 359 

*'Ah! misery, is it possible? We still managed to 
live before these horrors. We ate dry bread, but we 
were all together. . . . And what lias hajjpened 
now? My God! what have we done now, that we should 
be in sucli sorroAv, some underground, and the others 
hoping nothing but to be there? It's very true we were 
harnessed like horses to our work, and there was but 
little justice in the distribution of the blows we received 
as we went on swelling the fortunes of the rich without 
a hope of ever tasting any enjoyment ourselves! There 
is no pleasure in life when hope has gone. . . . Yes, 
it could not be endnred any longer, we had to breathe 
a little. But if we had known! Is it possible that we 
have made ourselves so wretched just because we wanted 
justice! " 

Sighs swelled her heart, her voice was suffocated in 
immeasurable sadness. 

Then, there are always wicked people there to prom- 
ise you that matters can be arranged if you will only 
take the trouble. . . . We grow hot-headed; we 
suffer so much from things as they are, that we ask for 
that which has no existence. I dreamed already like a 
beast; I saw before me a life of good-fellowship with all 
the world; I had sailed away in the air, I give you my 
word! . . . in the clouds! And we break our backs 
and fall back in the mud! It wasn't true; there was 
nothing over there of the things we imagined we saw. 
What tons there was increased wretchedness, ah! as 
much of it as v»^e wanted, and gun shots into the bargain! 

Etienne listened to this lament, and each tear seemed 
to sting him with remorse. He knew not what to say 
to quiet la Maheu, all bruised by her terrible fall from 
the pinnacle of her ideal. She had returned to the 
center of the room, she now looked at him; and then 
went on fiercely. 

" And you, do you also speak of returning to the 
mine after having tricked us all in? I reproach you 
with nothing. Only, if I were in your place, I would 
have died of grief for having brought so much sorrow 
on my comrades." 

He wished to reply, then he raised his shoulders de- 
spairingly; why give explanations which, in her grief, 
she would not understand; and, overpowered by suffer- 



360 GEEMINAL. 

ing, he went away, resuming outside his straggling walk. 
On again reaching tne alley, he found that the people 
seemed to be waiting for him. The men at the doors, 
the women at the windows. As soon as he appeared, 
grumblings ran round ; the crowd increased. A whisper, 
growing with the gossip of the last four days, culmi- 
nated in universal execration. Fists v/cre thrust tov/ard 
him, mothers slicwed him to their children, with a con- 
temptuous gesture, the old men spat on the ground 
when looking at him. It was the sudden change on the 
morrov/ of defeat, the reverse side of the medal of pop- 
ularity, an execration aggravated by all the sufferings 
endured in vain. Hunger and death were charged to 
him. 

Zacharie, who was arriving at his mother's with Phi- 
lomêne, stumbled against Etienne as he was going out, 
and he sneered maliciously. 

"See! he grows fat; the flesh of other people must be 
nourishing, then!" 

La Levaque was already at her door with Boute- 
loup. She was speaking of Bebert, her gamin, killed 
by a ball. She cried: 

"Yes; there are cowards who cause children to be 
massacred. Let him go, then, and look for mine under- 
ground, if he wants to return him to me." 

She forgot her imprisoned husband. The menage did 
not stop, as Bouteloup remained there. NotAvith- 
standing, the idea returned to her; she continued in a 
shrill voice: 

"Be off! only rogues walk about when honest men 
are in the shade." 

Etienne, to avoid her,hadrunagainstlaPierronne, who 
had hastened across the gardens. She had welcomed as 
a deliverance the death of her mother, whose violences 
threatened to have them hanged; and she had little 
regret for Pierron's little girl, that street-walker Lydie, 
a good riddance. But she joined the neighbors with the 
idea of making peace. 

"And my mother, say, and the little girl ! We saw 
you, you were hiding yourself behind them, when they 
swallowed the lead in your place." 

What was to bo done? Strangle la Pierronne and the 
others, and fight the whole alley? For an instant 



GERMIÎTAL. 361 

Etienne felt like it. Tlie blood rushed to his head; he 
thought of his comrades now as brute beasts. It 
irritated him to see tliem idiots and barbarians to such 
a degree as to charge upon him the logic of circum- 
stances. His inability to subdue them again and con- 
vince them filled him with sadness, and he only hastened 
his steps, as if deaf to their imprecations. Soon it be- 
came a flight, each house hooting at him as he passed, 
pressing on his heels, every one cursing him with voices 
growing gradually like thunder in the outbreak of their 
hate. It was he who had been working against them, 
the assassin, the sole cause of their misfortunes. 
He came out of the alley pale, worn, running, with this 
hooting crowd at his back. At last, on the road, many 
fell back, but some obstinately followed him with their 
imprecations. When at the foot of the hill, before 
L'Avantage, he encountered another gi'oup coming out 
of the Voreux. 

Old Mouque and Cheval were there. Since the 
death of his daughter, Mouquette, and of his son, 
Mouquet, the old man continued his work as groom, 
taciturn, without a word either of regret or of complaint. 
Suddenly, seeing Etienne pass, he shook with fnr\; 
tears gushed from his eyes, and a storm of invective 
burst from his mouth, black and bleeding from the 
habit of chev\àng. 

"You dirty fellow! You hog! . . . Wait, you've 
got to pay me for my poor little brats; you shall do it 
now!" 

He picked up a brick, broke it, and flung the two 
pieces at him. 

''Yes, yes! let us clean him!" cried Cheval, sneer- 
ingly, much excited and delighted with this vengeance. 
" Every one in his turn. . . . No\y you're fastened 
to the wall, you dirty fellow!" 

And he also pelted at Etienne with the stones. A 
savage clamor arose; all took bricks, broke them, threvv^ 
them to disembowel him, as they had wished to dis- 
embowel the soldiers. 

It was against him that the battle was now recommenc- 
ing. Stunned, he ran no longer; he faced them try- 
ing to avoid the pieces of brick, seeking words to soothe 
them. He recollected some passages from his old 



362 GERMINAL. 

speeches, so warmly aiiplauded formerly; he repeated 
the words with which he had intoxicated them at the 
time when he held them in his hand like a flock of 
sheep; but his power was dead; stones were the only 
replies his phrases continued to receive, and ho had just 
been wounded in the left arm; he was drawing back in 
great peril when he found himself beaten against the 
front of l'Avantage. 

At that instant Rasseneur had appeared at the door. 

" Come in," he simply said. 

Etienne hesitated; it choked him to take refuge there, 
to be saved by his rival. 

" Do come in, I'm going to speak to them." 

He resigned himself; he hid himself at the back of 
the saloon, trembling and ashamed, while the tavern- 
keeper blocked up the door with his large shoulders. 

"■ Look here, my friends, be reasonable. . . . 
You know well that / have never deceived you. I have 
always been in favor of peace, and if you had listened 
to me you would assuredly not have been where you are 
now." Wriggling from his shoulders downwards, he 
went on at length, he allowed the stream of his elo- 
quence to flow with the soothing mildness of lukewarm 
water. And all his former success was returning to 
him; without an effort his popularity was regained, 
naturally, just as if the comrades had not hooted at 
him as a coward a month ago; voices applauded him; 
very well; they agreed with him; that was the way to 
speak; a thunder of applause broke or burst forth. 

At the back of the room Etienne was sinking; his 
heart overwhelmed with bitterness. He recalled to 
mind Rasseneur's prediction in the forest when threat- 
ening him with the ingratitude of the mob. What im- 
becile brutality! What ?hiimeful forgetfnlness of ser- 
vices rendered! It was a blind forcf^ constantly devour- 
ing itself. And beneath his anger at seeing these 
brutes ruin their cause, there was the despair of his 
own fall, the tragic ending of his ambition. What! 
was this the end already? He remembered having 
heard under the brushwood three thousand breasts beat- 
ing to the echo of his own. On that day he held his 
popularity in his two hands; these people belonged to 
him; he felt himself their master. Foolish dreams 



GEEMINAL. 363 

intoxicated him at that time. Montson at his feet, 
Paris over there, a deputy, perhaps, terrifying the 
bourgeois by a speech, the first speech made by a work- 
man at the tribunal of a parliament. And it was 
ended, nothing remained but the pieces on the ground; 
liis people had just rewarded him with a shower of 
bricks! 

Easseneur raised his voice: 

'' Yioleuce has never been successful; the world can- 
not be re-made in a day. Those who promised you to 
change everything at a blow are jesters or rogues!" 

" Bravo! bravo! " cried the crowd. 

Who, then, was to blame? and this question which 
Etienne asked himself completely overwhelmed him. 
Could they really be laid at his door — these misfortunes 
from which he himself was bleeding, the misery of 
some, the throttling of others, these women, these chil- 
dren, lean from hunger and without bread? One even- 
ing, before these disasters, he had had a sad vision like 
this. But he was already in motion, and he found 
himself carried on by his comrades. Besides, he had 
never directed them; it was they who led him; who 
forced him to do things which otherwise he never would 
have done without the impetus of this crowd galloping 
behind him. After each outbreak he had remained 
stupefied at the results, for he had neither foreseen nor 
desired them. Could he have expected, for instance, 
that his faithful followers of the alley would stone him 
one day? These madmen lied when they accused him 
of having promised them a life of eating and idleness. 
They had dreamed these things; he had not even 
wished for the strike. And in this justification, in the 
reasons with which he tried to combat his remorse, was 
stirring the dim or faint uneasiness of not having shown 
himself equal to his task, this doubt of the half edu- 
cated which always hampered him. But he, that his 
strength had deserted him; he had even less courage than 
his comrades; he was afraid of them; of this enormous 
mass, blind and irresistible, passing over like one of 
nature's elements, sweeping all before it, in defiance of 
rules and theories. Repugnance separated him still 
farther from them — the discomforts of which his more 



364 GERMINAL. 

refined tastes made him sensible — the gradual ascent of 
his whole being toward a superior class. 

At this moment the voice of Rasseneur was lost in the 
midst of enthusiastic vociferations. 

"Long live Easseneur! he's the man for us! Bravo! 
bravo!" 

The tavernkeeper shut the door again, while the band 
dispersed, and the two men silently looked at each other. 
Both raised their shoulders; they ended by drinking a 
glass together. 

In the evening of the same day there was a grand 
dinner at Piolaiue in honor of the betrothal of Megrel 
and Cécile. For three days past the Gregoires had been 
waxing the dining-room floor and dusting the drawing- 
room. Melanie reigned in the kitchen, watching the 
roast meats, stirring the gravies, whose odor ascended 
even to the garrets. It had been decided that Francis, 
the coachman, should help Honorine in Avaitiug. The 
gardener's wife was to wash the dishes, the gardener 
would open the door. Never had the large, patriarchal 
and substantial-looking house seen such a gala day. 

Everything went on delightfully. Madame Henne- 
beau behaved charmingly toward Cécile, and smiled at 
Megrel when the notary of Montson gallantly proposed 
to drink to the happiness of the future household. M. 
Hennebeau was also very amiable, and his air of gaiety 
was much remarked; it was said that, restored to favor 
by the administration, he was about to be made an officer 
of the Legion of Honor in consequence of the energetic 
manner in which he had put down the strike. They 
avoided speaking of the recent occurrences, but there 
was an air of triumph amid the general festivity; the 
dinner assumed the appearance of an official celebration 
of a victory. At last that trouble was over, and they 
could begin again to eat and sleep in peace. 

An allusion was discreetly made to the dead, whose 
blood had hardly yet been soakçd up by the mud of the 
Voreux; it was a salutary lesson, and all were touched 
when the Gregoires added that it was now the duty of 
each to go and staunch the wounds in the alley. They 
had resumed their benevolent placidity, pardoning their 
brave miners, seeing them already at the bottom of the 
jnines setting a good example of secular resignation, 



GERMINAL. 365 

The notables of Montson, who trembled no longer, 
agreed that something ought to be done to improve the 
pay department. At tlie second coarse, the victory was 
completed when M. Hennebeau announced that he had 
received from the bishop a formal promise to remove 
the Abbe Eanvier; a person with such dangerous views 
could not be retained in the center of an industrial com- 
munity; all the people in the neighborhood commented 
with much heat on the history of this priest who had 
spoken of the soldiers as assassins. And as the dessert 
came on, the notary resolutely took up the role of a free 
thinker. Deneulin was there with his two daughters. 
In the midst of this gaiety, he endeavored to conceal 
the melancholy induced by his ruined condition. Only 
that morning he had put his signature to the sale of his 
concession of Vandame to the company. Cornered, 
throttled, he had submitted to the exactions of the 
managers, abandoning to them, at a low figure, the prey 
he had watched for so long, and not even receiving 
enough from them to pay his creditors. He had even 
at the last moment, as a happy chance, their offer to 
retain him as an engineer of the division, resigned to 
superintend thus simply, as a paid employe, this mine 
where he had sunk his fortune. It was the knell of the 
small enterprise of individuals, the aj)proaching disap- 
pearance of patrons, eaten up one by one by the hungry 
ogre of capital, drowned in the rising flood of large 
companies. He alone was paying the costs of the strike; 
he felt well enough that they were drinking to his mis- 
fortune, wlien toasting M. Hennebeau's rosette; and it 
was only the sight of Lucie's and Jeanne's charming 
appearance in their refreshened toilettes, gay with 
laughter, like pretty hoydens scornful of money — that 
consoled him a little. When they passed into the draw- 
ing-room, M. Hennebeau drew his cousin aside and 
congratulated him on his decision. 

'* What would you have? Your sole error has been 
in risking at Vandame the million of your stock of 
Montson. It was a terrible calamity you drew upon 
yourself, and now it has melted into this dog's work, 
while my capital, whicli has not stirred from my drawer, 
still supports me comfortably without work, as it will 
support the children of my grandchildren."

CHAPTER XXXVI. 

On Sunday, Etienne escaped from the alley as soon 
as night fell. A clear sky, spangled with stars, lighted 
the earth with the bluish shade of twilight. He went 
down toward the canal, he slowly followed the bank in 
going toward Marchiennes. 

It was his favorite promenade, a turfed path of two 
leagues, running in a straight line without a turn, 
without a declivity, the length of this regular stream, 
which spread itself out like a gigantic ingot of melted 
lead. 

He never met anybody. But this day he was vexed 
on seeing a man coming toward him. And under the 
pale light of the stars the two solitary pedestrians only 
recognized each other when face to face. 

"Ah! it^s you," murmured Etienne. 

Jouvarine nodded without answering. For an in- 
stant they remained motionless; then side by side they 
set off again toward Marchiennes. Each seemed to 
pursue his reflections as if far off from the other. 

'' Have you road in the Journal of Pluchart's success 
in Paris?" at last asked Etienne. " They were awaiting 
him on the sidewalk, they gave him an ovation on leav- 
ing the meeting at Montmartre. . . . Oh! he is 
launched now, in spite of his coldness. He will go 
where he pleases henceforth." The machinist shrugged 
his shoulders. He had a contempt for fine speakers, 
lively fellows who went into politics, as they would take 
to the bar, to make themselves an income by dint of 
fine phrases. 

Etienne was now deep in Darwin. He bad read some 
fragments of his, epitomized and diluted, in a five cent 
volume; and from this reading, imperfectly understood, 
he formed a revolutionary idea of the combat for exist- 
ence, the lean ones eating the fat ones, the strong peo- 
ple devouring the weak peasantry. But Jouvarine 
grew angry, and dilated on the stupidity of the social- 
ists who accept Darwin, that apostle of scientific in- 
equality, whose famous selection was only good for aris- 
tocratic philosophers. But his comrade was obstinate; 



GERMINAL. 367 

he wished to reason, and he expressed his doubts by an 
hypothesis: the old society no longer existed, even the 
crumbs had been swept away; well, was it not to be 
feared that tiie new world would sprout up slowly 
spoiled by the same wrongs, some sick, the others in 
good health; some, more skillful, more intelligent, fat- 
tening on everything; the others, imbecile and idle, 
returning to slavery? Then, before this vision of per- 
petual misery, the machinist cried savagely that if just- 
ice was not possible with man, man must disappear. 
As many as were the rotten societies, as many should be 
the massacres until the extermination of the last being. 
And silence fell again. 

For a long time, with lowered head, Jouvarine 
walked along the soft grass which gave no sound to his 
steps, so absorbed that he followed the extreme edge of 
the water with the tranquil security of a sleeping man, 
dreaming the whole length of the roofs. Then, with- 
out cause, he shivered as if he had stumbled against a 
ghost. His eyes were raised, his face appeared, and he 
said quietly to his companion: 

" Did I ever tell you how she died? " 

''Who?" 

" My wife, over there in Eussia." 

Etienne moved vaguely, astonished at the shaking of 
his voice, at this sudden need of sympathy from a man 
of such an habitually impassive nature, in his stoic sep- 
aration from others and from himself. He only knew 
that his wife was a mistress and that they had hung her 
in Moscow. 

" The affair had not succeeded," continued -Jouvarine, 
his eyes lost at present on the white running of the 
canal between the bluish colonnades of the tall trees. 
"We had been fourteen days at the bottom of a hole, 
undermining a railway; and it was not an imperial 
train, it was a train of travelers which was blown up. 
Then they arrested Annouchka. She used to bring us 
bread every evening, disguised as a peasant. It was 
she also who had applied the match, for a man might 
have been remarked. I watched the trial, lost in the 
crowd, at the tribunal. I went to the square the last 
day. . . ." 



368 GEEMINAL. 

His voice faltered; a fit of congliing seized him, as if 
he were strangling. 

" Twice I felt like crying out and jumping over the 
heads to rejoin her. But what good would it do? A 
man less was a soldier less; and I well understood that 
she was saying no to me, when her large, fixed eyes en- 
countered mine." 

He coughed again. 

" On that day it rained; the awkward creatures could 
not make an end of it under the beating rain. They 
had taken twenty minutes to hang four others; the 
rope broke, they could not finish the fourth. . . . 
And Annouchka remained standing, waiting. She 
could not see me, she was seeking me in the crowd. 

I mounted a mile-stone and she saw me; from that 
moment our eyes never left each other. When she was 
dead she was still looking at me. I waved my hat and 
I went away." 

He again became silent. The snow-white water of the 
canal rolled on to the infinite; both men walked with 
the same deadened step as each again fell into his isola- 
tion. At the bottom of the horizon the pale water 
seemed to spread out on the sky with a small spot of 
light. 

"It was our punishment," resumed Jouvarine slowly. 
" We were guilty of loving each other. . . . Yes, it 
is best that she is dead; her blood brought forth some 
heroes, and I am no longer cowardly at heart. . 
Ah! I have no one, parents, wife or friend! no one 
whose hand would even tremble the day when it will be 
necessary for me to take the life of others or give my 
own." 

Etienne paused, shivering under the fresh night. He 
did not dispute him, he simply said: 

" We have gone very far, do you not think we had 
better turn back?" 

They slowly returned toward the Voreux, and he 
added, at the end of some steps. 

" Have you seen the new bills." 

He meant the great yellow placards which the com- 
pany had stuck up that morning. It was becoming 
more frank and more conciliating; it promised to take 
back even the discharged miners if they would again 



GERMINAL. 369 

descend the following day. All would be pardoned; 
they would even forget that which was done by the 
leaders themselves. 

"Yes, I have seen it/' responded the machinest. 

'' Well ! what do you think of it ?" 

** I think that it is over. . . . The people will 
go down again. You are all too cowardly." 

Etienne generously excused his comrades ; they were 
brave men, perhaps, but when one is dying of hunger 
he is without strength. Step by step they were return- 
ing to the Voreux ; and before the black mass of the 
mine, he continued, he swore never to descend again, 
but he would pardon those who should go down. Then, 
as a report had been spread that the carpenters had not 
had time to repair the tubbing, he desired to know about 
it. Was that true ? had the weight of the rocks against 
the lining of the shaft, a piece of carpenter work, 
pushed them out so much that a cage had rubbed against 
the sides the length of more than five metres ? Jouva- 
rine again became very cool, responding briefly. He 
had worked the day before ; the cage did rub, that 
was true; the engineers were even obliged to double the 
power to pass through that place. But all the cliiefs 
received these observations with the same irritated 
sentence: It was coal that they wished now; they would 
make repairs better later on. 

" Bat don't you see that it will burst?" said Etienne. 
" What a situation they will be in ! " 

With liis eyes fixed upon that mine indistinct in the 
shadows, Jouvarine concluded tranquilly : 

''If that bursts, the comrades will be killed, whom 
you counsel to again descend.'" 

The clock in Montson was striking nine, and his com- 
panion having said that he was going to enter the house 
and go to bed, he added, without even holding out his 
hand : 

" Well! good bye; I am going away." 

'' What! you are going away?" 

" Yes. I have asked for my livret to be given back; 
I am going somewhere else." 

Etienne, stupefied, filled with emotion, looked at 
him, x^fter a walk of two hours, lie had said that, 
and with a voice so calm, when the very announcement 
24 



370 GERMINAL. 

of that sudden separation wrung his heart. They knew 
each other, though they were scarcely ever together; 
and the idea of seeing him no longer seemed sad. 

*' You are going away; and where are you going? " 

" I do not know." 

" But vou will return? " 

"No, I think not." 

They became silent. They remained for a moment 
face to face, without finding other words to say. 

"Good-bye, then." 

" Good-bye." 

As Etienne went up the alley, Jouvarine turned his 
back and returned along the border of the canal; and 
then, alone now, he walked on and on with head down, 
so drowned in the shadows that he himself was but a 
shadow moving along in the night. At times he paused, 
counting the hours striking in the distance. When 
midnight sounded, he suddenly left the canal and direct- 
ed his steps toward the Yoreux. 

At that moment the mine was deserted; he only met 
an overseer, whose eyes were half closed with fatigue. 
At two o'clock they were obliged to fire up again for 
the resume of work. At first he went up to take from 
the bottom of a closet a vest which he pretended to 
have forgotten. A wimble and an auger, a little but 
very strong saw, a hammer and a pair of shears were 
rolled in that vest. Then he started forth, but instead 
of going out by the waiting room he went toward the 
opening which led to the ladder. And with his vest 
under his arm, he descended softly, without a lamp, 
measuring the depth by counting the ladders. He 
knew that the cage rubbed, at three hundred and 
seventy-four metres, against the fourth passage of the 
lower tubbing. When he had counted fifty-four ladders 
he groped with his hand, he felt the bulging of the 
pieces of wood. It was there. 

Then, with the address and sang-froid of a good 
workman, who, for a long time, has meditated over his 
work, he started at his labor. He at once began saw- 
ing a panel of eighty centimetres in the place parti- 
tioned off for the ladders, so as to communicate with 
the extraction compartment. And, with the assistance 
of matches quickly lit and extinguished he was able to 



GERMIÎSTAL. 371 

notice the state of the tubbing and the recent repairs 
which had been made. 

Between Cahiis and Valenciennes the sinking of mine 
shafts met with some unheard of difficulties, in travers- 
ing the masses of water under the ground in immense 
sheets on a level with the lowest valley. Only the con- 
struction of the tubbings, of the carpenter work in 
pieces joined together like the staves of a cask, suc- 
ceeded in retaining the tributary streams so as to sep- 
arate the shafts in the midst of lakes of uncertain 
depth and obscurity, which beat against the walls. At 
the Voreux they had been compelled to establish two 
tubbings: that of the superior level in the falling sand 
and the white clay which was near the cretaceous 
ground, cracked in all parts, filled with water like a 
sponge ; then that of the inferior level, directly above 
the coal regions, in the midst of a yellow sand as fine 
as meal, running with a liquid fluidity; and it was there 
that the torrent was found, that subterranean sea, the 
terror of the coal men of the North, — a sea with its 
tempests and its wrecks, an unknown and fathomless 
sea rolling its black billows more than three hundred 
metres from the sun. Ordinarily the tubbing held well 
under the enormous pressure. They feared little but 
the sinking of the neighboring ground, shaken by the 
continued work of the old galleries of exploration which 
were now filled up. In that descent of the rocks some- 
times breaks were produced, slowly spreading them- 
selves out as far as the carpenter work, which they at 
length weakened by pushing it into the interior of the 
shaft; and the great danger was there, a threatened 
cave-in, an inundation, the mine filled up by an avalanche 
of the ground and a deluge of water. 

Jouvarine, in the opening made by himself, ascer- 
tained a very grave deformation of the fifth passage of 
the tubbing. The pieces of wood bulged out beyond 
the frames; several even had come out of their joints. 
Abundant filtrations fell from the joints across some 
tarred filterers with which the shaft was lined. And 
the carpenters, pressed for time, had been forced to 
content themselves with placing at the angles some 
stays of iron with such carelessness that all the screws 



372 GERMINAL. 

were not tight. A considcr.ible movement was evi- 
dently produced behind, in the sand of the Torrent. 

Then, with his wimble, he commenced to loosen the 
screws from the pieces of iron in a manner so that a last 
push would destroy all. It was a work of fooMsli 
temerity, during which he was in danger twenty times to 
be thrown head over heels, making the fall of a hundred 
and twenty-five metres which still separated him from the 
bottom. He had been obliged to grasp the timbers 
from which the cages hung, and, suspended above 
vacant sjiace, he traveled the length of the cross-beams, 
which were placed short distances apart. He slipped 
along, turning round, simply propped up by an elbow 
or knee in tranquil scorn of death. A breath would 
have precipitated him. Three times without even a 
shiver he caught himself in the act of falling. At first 
he felt with his hand, then he worked, only lighting a 
match when he was lost amid sticky beams. When the 
screws were loosened he even attacked the pieces of tub- 
bing, and his peril grew still greater. He found the 
principal piece which held the others. He was excited 
over it. He bored holes in it, sawed it, made it thin, 
so that it lost its resistance, while through the holes and 
cracks the water, which escajied in small streams, 
blinded and soaked him with its icy rain. Two matches 
were extinguished. Everything streamed with water. 
It was night, a profound darkness without an end of 
shadows. 

From that moment passion carried him away. The 
breath of the invisible intoxicated him, the black hor- 
ror of that hole beaten by the storm threw him into a 
fury for destruction. He became infuriated by chance 
against the tubbing, beating where he could with blows 
of the wimble, and hacking it with the shears, taken 
with a wish to immediately break it open over his head. 
And he was as ferocious as if he was plunging the knife 
into the skin of a human being whom he abhorred. 
He would end by killing it, that bad beast of a Voreux, 
with its jaws always open, which had swallowed up so 
much human flesh. The scraping of his tools went on, 
he stretched himself out on his small back, he crept 
along, descending and remounting, still holding on as 



GERMINAL. 373 

by a miracle, in a continued shaking, from the flight of 
nocturnal birds across the carpenter-work of the lower. 

But he calmed himself, angry at his violence. Could 
he not do these things coldly? Without haste he took 
a breath and re-entered the opening to the ladders, 
where he stopped up the hole by again putting in place 
the panel he had sawed away. It was enough; he did 
net wish to give the alarm by a havoc too great, which 
they would have attempted to repair at once. The 
beast had its wound 'in its stomach, and by night they 
w^ould see if it still lived; and he could make the sign 
of the cross; the frightened world would know that it 
did not die an easy death. He took the time to 
methodically roll np the tools in his vest and then again 
slowly ascended the ladders. Then he thought of going 
out of the mine without being seen, the idea of chang- 
ing his clothing never occurring to him. The clock 
struck three. He remained planted upon the road; he 
was waiting. 

At the same hour, Etienne, who had not slept, became 
uneasy at a slight noise heard in the thick darkness of 
his chamber. lie distinguished the slight breathing of 
the children, the snores of Bonnemort and la Maheu; 
while beside him Jeanlin blew out one prolonged note 
like a flute. Without doubt he had been dreaming, and 
he sank back on the pillow as the noise again com- 
menced. It was the creaking of a bed, the suppressed 
efforts of a person to rise. Then he imagined that 
Catherine was ill. 

*' Say, is that you ? What's the matter ?'' he asked, 
in a low voice. 

No one responded, only the snores of the others con- 
tinued. For ten minutes nothing stirred. Then the 
cracking again began. And this time, certain that he 
was not dreaming, he crossed the room, holding out his 
hands in the darkness to feel the bed in front of him. 
His surprise was great when he encountered the young 
girl sitting up, holding her breath, awake and on the 
watch. 

" Well ! why didn't you answer ? What are you 
doing?" 

At length she said in a low voice : 

*' I am getting up." 



374 GERMINAL. 

" You're getting up. at this hour?" 

" Yes, I'm going back to work in the mine. 

Very much agitated, Etienne seated himself on the 
edge of the mattress, while Catherine excitedly ex- 
plained her reasons. Siie suffered more from living 
thus in idleness, on seeing thrown upon her a continued 
look of reproach; she would rather run the risk of 
being kicked down there by Cheval; and if her mother 
did not wish her money, when she brought it to her, 
why! she was large enough to use a part of it in making 
the soup herself. 

"Go way now, I'm going to dress. And don't say 
anything, if you wish to be good to me." 

But he remained beside her, and .suddenly she, 
throwing her arm around his neck, began to cry very 
softly: 

"Go back to bed," murmured she. "I cannot light 
the candle, for that would wake mamma. It is late, so 
leave me." 

He no longer listened; he pressed her to him, his 
heart drowned in an immense sadness. A wish for 
peace, a wish to be happy, filled his thoughts; and he 
saw himself married in a neat little house, without 
other ambition than to live and die there both together. 
Bread would content them; and even if they had only 
enough for one, that piece should be for her. What 
good was all else? Did life hold more? 

She, however, unwound his arms. 

"I beg of you, leave me!" 

Then, in a burst of his heart, he said in her ear: 

"Wait; I will go with you." 

He was astonished at having said that. He had 
sworn not to again descend ; from whence came that 
sudden decision; he had thought he would not consider 
it an instant. îCow there was in him such a calm, such 
a complete recovery from his doubts, when he had been 
so obstinate; a man saved by chance, who had found at 
last the strange door to his pain. So he refused to 
listen to her when she became alarmed, comprehending 
that he was doing this for her, thinking of the bad words 
with which they spoke of him at the mine. He mocked 
at all; the bills promised pardon, and that sufi&amp;ced. 



GEEMIISTAL. 375 

''I wish to work; it is my idea. . . . Dress your- 
self and don't make any noise." 

They dressed themselves in the darkness, with a 
thousand precautions not to wake anyone. She had 
secretly prepared the night before her mining clothing; 
in the closet he found a vest and pair of pants; and they 
did not even wash themselves for fear of shaking the 
floor. Everyone still slept, but it was necessary to pass 
by the little room in which the mother slept. When they 
started out, in their great fear, they knocked against a 
chair. She awoke, she called out in a half sleep: 

"What's that?" 

Catherine, trembling, paused and pressed Etienne's 
hand tight. 

" It's me, don't be frightened," said the latter. '*I'm 
warm, I'm going out for some air." 

"All right." 

And la Maheu went to sleep again. Catherine no 
longer dared breathe. At last she descended to the room 
below; she divided a sandwich which she had saved from 
a loaf given her by a woman in Montson. Then he 
softly shut the door behind them and they went away. 

Jouvarine was standing outside, near l'Avantage at an 
angle of the road. For a half hour he had watched the 
coal men who were returning to work, a number of 
shadows, passing on with the dull sound of the march- 
ing of troops. He counted them as the butchers count 
their beasts on their entrance to the abattoir; and he 
was surprised at their number; he had not imagined, 
even in his pessimism, that the number of covt^ards would 
be so great. The line stretched out; he was very cold, 
his teeth pressed together, his eyes clear. 

But he started. Among those men who were going 
toward the mine, and of whom he could not distinguish 
the faces, he recognized one by his walk. He advanced 
and stopped him. 

"Where are you going?" 

Etienne, overwhelmed instead of replying, stammered: 

"Haven't you started yet?" Then he owned up he 
was returning to the mine. Without doubt he had 
sworn; but it was not life to wait with arms folded for 
things to arrive in a hundred years perhaps; and then 
some things had decided him. 



37G GERMINAL. 

Jouvarine listened to him, shivering. He caught 
him by the shoulder and turned him towards the alley. 

"Go home, I wish it, do you understand!" 

But Catherine had approached; he recognized her 
also. Etienne protested, declared that he would allow 
no one to be the judge of liis conduct. And the eyes of 
the engineer turned to the young girl as to a comrade, 
while he recoiled a step with a gesture of sudden aban- 
don, as a man who comprehended. When there was a 
woman in the heart of a man, the man was finished, he 
could die. Perhaps he saw in a rapid vision, at Mos- 
cow, his mistress who was hung — that last link broken 
which had rendered him free as to the life of others or 
his own. He again became cool, and said simply: 

*'Go." 

Uneasy, Etienne stood still, trying to say a kind 
word so as not to separate thus. 

''Then you are still going away?" 

" Yes." 

*'Well! give me your hand, old fellow. A pleasant 
journey to you and don't think hard of me." 

The other held out an ice-cold hand. No friend, no 
woman. 

"Good-bye forever this time." 

" Yes, good-bye." 

And Jouvarine, motionless in the shadows, followed 
with a glance Etienne and Catherine, who entered the 
Voreux. 



CHAPTEE XXXVII. 



At four o'clock the descent commenced. Danseart, 
installed in person in the receiver's office, in the lamp 
room, wrote down the name of each workman as he 
presented himself, and ordered him a lamp. He took 
them all, without a word, according to the promise 
made in the handbills. Nevertheless, when he per- 
ceived Etienne and Catherine at the wicket gate, he 
started, reddened, and his mouth opened to refuse 
their names; then he contented himself with a triumphs 
ant chuckle. " Ah! ah! the strongest of the strong was 
floored now! The company was worth something still 



GERMINAL. 377 

since the terrible wrestler of Montson returned to ask 
bread from them." Silently, Etienne took his lamp 
and went up to the shaft with the pusher. But it was 
there, in the receiving room, that Catherine feared the 
sharp words of the comrades. The moment she entered, 
siie perceived Cheval, among twenty others, waiting 
until a cage should be free. He advanced furiously to- 
ward her, when the sight of Etienne stopped him. 
Then he affected to sneer, shrugging his shoulders vio- 
lently. He was well rid of her; the gentleman was 
quite welcome to her nov/; and while thus expressing 
his contempt, he trembled with jealousy, and his eyes 
sparkled. The other comrades had not moved; mute, 
with their eyes on the ground, oppressed with gloom, 
they contented themselves with a side glance at the 
last comers; then, as if themselves ashamed of being 
there, beaten into silence, they resumed their fixed look 
at the mouth of the shaft, their lamps in their hands, 
shivering under their linen blouses in the strong cur- 
rents of air from the large room. 

At last the cage was lowered on the bolts, and the 
order given to embark. Etienne and Catherine crowded 
into a car which Pierion and two others had already 
entered. At the side, in another car. Cheval was say- 
ing aloud to old Mouque that the managers were very 
wrong not to take advantage of the opportunity of rid- 
ding the mines of the blackguards who were destroying 
them; but the old groom, already gone back to the 
resignation of his dog's life, no longer troubled by the 
death of his children, replied only by a careless con- 
ciliatory gesture. 

The cage unhooked, they entered the darkness. No 
one spoke. Suddenly, at two-thirds of the descent, 
there was a terrible shaking. The irons cracked, the 
men were thrown against each other. 

''My God!" groaned Etienne, "do they want to 
crush us. We'll all stay here, with their d d tub- 
bing. And they still say they have repaired it! " 

Nevertheless the cage had broken through the ob- 
stacle. Now it was passing through such a violent 
storm of rain that the workmen listened uneasily to the 
rushing water. Leaks had then broken out between 
the joints! 



378 GERMI]SrAL. 

Pierron, when questioned as one who had been mak- 
ing the descent for several days past, would give no 
sign of the fear he felt, as it might be considered an 
attack on the managers; and he rei)lied: 

" Oh! there's no danger! It's always like tliis. No 
doubt they have not had time to finish their mending." 

The torrent poured on their heads; they arrived at 
the bottom, at the last hook, under a veritable v/ater- 
spout. Not one overseer had thought of going up the 
ladders to look after it. The pump would suffice; the 
repairers would visit the joints the next night. 

In the galleries, the reorganization of labor brought 
many evils. Before allowing the diggers to resume 
work in the timber-yards, the engineer had decided 
that during the first five days all the men should be put 
to certain work of strengthening of urgent necessity. 
Breaking in was threatened everywhere; the roads had 
suffered to such a degree, that the woodwork had to be 
repaired for the length of several hundred kilometres. 
Gangs were therefore formed below of ten men, each 
under the direction of an overseer ; then they were set 
to work at the place most endangered. When the 
descent was finished, it was found that some three 
hundred odd miners had come down, about half the 
number working when the mine was in full force. 

Cheval just made up the gang of which Etienne and 
Catherine formed a part ; and this was not by chance; 
he had at first placed himself behind his comrades, and 
then he forced himself on the overseer's notice. This 
gang had gone to clear away at the end of the north 
gallery of nearly three kilometres, a cave-in which 
blocked up a road in the Dix-Huit-Ponces Vein. They 
attacked the falling stones with pick-axe and shovel. 
Etienne, Cheval and five others cleared away, whilst 
Catherine, with two boys of sixteen, rolled away the 
earth to the inclined plane. Words were rare, the over- 
seer did not leave them. Nevertheless, the girl's two 
lovers were on the point of boxing each other on her 
account. Though muttering that he wanted no more 
of the vile creature, the old one still watched and slyly 
hustled her so much that the new one threatened to give 
him a dance if he did not leave her alone. They ate 
each other with their eyes, and had to be separated. 



GERMINAL. 379 

Towards five o'clock Dansaert came along, giving a 
glance at the work. He seemed to be in an execrable 
temper, and grew angry with the overseer; notliing 
went on right ; the woodwork ouglit to be strengthened; 
what the devil did they me;in by such work ? And he 
went off saying that he would return with the engineer. 
He had been awaiting Megrel since morning, without 
knowing the cause of his delay. 

Another hour passed. The overseer had stopped the 
clearing away to put all his men at propping the roof. 
Even the girl and the two bojs were no longer rolling, 
they v»ere preparing and bringing the woodwork. At 
the back of this gallery the gang seemed to be at a re- 
lay station, lost at the extremity of the mine, cut off 
henceforth, from communication with the other works. 
Strange noises were heard three or four times, distant 
galloping made the laborers turn their heads: what 
was it then? one would think that the roads were bei'ig 
deserted, the comrades rushing up already at racing 
speed? But the noise died away in profound silence; 
they went on with the wedging of the wood, stunned 
by the loud blows of the hammers. At last they re- 
sumed the clearing away, the rolling recommenced. 

From the first trip Catherine returned in a fright, 
saying there was no longer anyone at the inclmed 
plane. 

"I called, but no one answered. They've all gone 
away." 

The panic was such that the ten men threw down 
their tools to rush off. The idea of being abandoned 
thus, alone at the bottom of the mine, so far from the 
shaftroom, froze their blood. They had only kept 
their lamp; they ran single file, the men, the chil- 
dren, the girl; the overseer himself losing his head, 
screaming for help, more and more terrified at the si- 
lence in this wilderness of galleries without end. What 
had happened that they did not meet with a single soul? 
What accident could have carried off their comrades 
thus? Their terror was aggravated by the uncertainty 
of the danger, by the threatening which they felt with- 
out understanding it. 

At last, as they approached the shaftroom, a torrent 
reached them. They were immediately up to their 



380 GEKMIXAL. 

knees in water, and they could no longer run; they 
waded painfully through the water, with the thought 
tliat a minute's delay would be death to them. 

''My God!" cried Etienne, "the tubbing has given 
way! I said truly that we would stay here!" 

Since tlie descent Pierron had noticed, with great 
uneasiness, the increasing deluge falling from the shaft. 
While continuing the loading of the cars with two 
others he raised his head, his face bathed in perspiration, 
his ears buzzing with the rumbling of the tempest over- 
head. Bat he trembled above all when he perceived 
that under him the water-pump, ten metres deep, was 
filling up ; already the water was spouting from the 
ceiling, running over the flagging, and it proved that 
the pump was no longer sufficient to exhaust the leak- 
age. He heard it working laboriously with a weary 
rattle. Then he informed Dansaert, who swore with 
anger as he replied that they must await the engineer. 
Twice again he returned to the charge, without drawing 
from him any other reply than an exasperated shrug of 
his shoulders. Well, the water was rising, what could 
he do? 

Mouque appeared with Bataille, taking him to his 
drudgery, and he had to hold him with both hands; the 
sleepy old horse had suddenly reared, his head stretched 
out towards the shaft, neighing furiously. 

"What's the matter. Philosopher? What troubles 
you ? . . . Ah ! it's because it rains. Come, that 
doesn't concern you." 

But the animal shuddered all over; he had to drag 
him forcibly to the* work. 

Almost at the same instant as Mouque and Bataille 
disappeared at the end of the gallery a ci*ash was heard, 
followed by the prolonged rumbling of a fall. It was a 
piece of the tubbing, which had been detached, falling 
from a distance of a hundred and eighty metres and 
rebounding against the walls. Pierron and the carmen 
had saved themselves, tlie oak plank only crushed an 
empty car. At the same time a considerable body of 
water, a spouting wave from a broken dike, rushed in. 

Dansaert wished to go up to see, but while he was 
speaking a second piece rolled out; and, terrified by the 
threatened catastrophe, he hesitated no longer. He gave 



GERMIXAL, 381 

the order to ascend, and sent off overseers to warn the 
men at the works. 

Then a frightful hustling commenced. From each 
gallery there streamed a file of workmen to rush into 
the cages. They crushed each other; they were killing 
each other in their eagerness to get up at once. Some 
who had thought of taking the ladder-opening came 
down again, crying out that the passage was already 
blocked up. And this was the dread of all, after each 
departure of a cage: that one had passed, but who could 
say that the next one would, in the midst of the obsta- 
cles with which the shaft was obstructed? Up above, 
the overflow continued. They heard a series of heavy 
detonations, the splitting of the woodwork breaking 
away in tlie rumbling and constantly increasing shower. 
One cage soon became useless, broken in, no longer 
sliding between the ropes — broken, no doubt. The 
other rubbed in such a manner that the cable would 
certainly break. And there were still about a hundred 
men to come out, all shouting, clutching each other, 
covered wàth blood, drowning. Two were killed by the 
falling of the planks. A third, who had clutched the 
cage, fell back again fifty metres and disapjieared in the 
water-sump. 

Dansaert, nevertheless, tried to keep order. Armed 
with a pick, he threatened to break the head of the 
first person who failed to obey; and he wished to range 
them in file, crying out that the loaders would go out the 
last, after having packed up their comrades. They did 
not listen to him. He had prevented Pierron, pale and 
cowardly, from passing on among the first. At each 
departure, he pushed him aside with a cuff. But his 
own teeth were chattering. A minute more and he 
would be lost; everything was caving in above; it was 
an overflowing flood, a murderous rain of planks. A 
few workmen remained, when, crazed by fear, he 
jumped into a car, letting Pierron jump in behind him. 
The cage ascended. 

Just at this moment the gang of Etienne and Cheval 
came out into the shaft-room. They saw the cage dis- 
appear, they rushed forward; but they had to draw 
back from the final breaking up of the tubbing; the 
shaft was blocked up, the cage would not come down 



382 GEKMIKAL. 

again. Catherine was sobbing. Cheval was choking 
himself shrieking out oaths. They v/ere twenty in 
number. Would those hogs of chiefs adandon them 
thus? The father Mouque, who had brought back Ba- 
taille, without haste, still held him by the bridle, both 
stupefied, the old man and the animal, by the rapid 
rising of the flood. The water already reached the 
waist. Etienne, mute, with clenched teeth, supported 
Catherine in his arms. And all shouted with uplifted 
faces, all foolishly striving to look at the shaft, this 
blocked-up hole which spit out a flood and from whence 
help could come to them no more. On disembarking 
above, Dansaert perceived Megrel running there. By 
some fatality, Madame Hennebeau ha.d that morning 
detained him to look for one of the catalogues for the 
purchase of the trousseau. It was ten o'clock. 

" Well, what has happened?" cried he from afar. 

" The mine is lost," replied the superintendent. 

And he related the catastrophe stammeringly, while 
the incredulous engineer shrugged his shoulders. Non- 
sense! Could a tubbing be demolished like that? They 
must be exaggerating; it must be looked into. 

" There is nobody remaining down there, is there?" 

Dansaert was uneasy; no, nobody; he hoped so, at 
least; nevertheless the workmen might have been de- 
layed. 

" But, you dog! " cried Megrel, " why did you leave 
them? Do we desert our men?" 

Instantly he gave orders to count the lamps. In the 
morning three hundred and twenty-two had been given 
out, and but two hundred and fifty-five could be found, 
but several workmen confessed that theirs had remained 
down there, fallen from their hands in the hustling of 
the panic. They endeavored to call the roll. It was 
impossible to fix the exact number. Some miners had 
gone off, others did not hoar their names any longer. 
None seemed to agree as to the number of the missing 
comrades. There might be twenty, perhaps forty. 

One thing alone was certain to the engineer, there 
were men at the bottom. They heard their shouting 
amidst the noise of the waters rushing across the 
broken beams when they leaned over the opening of the 
shaft. 



GERMIXAL. 383 

Megrel's first care Tvas to send the information to M. 
Hennebeau, and to try to close the mine. But it was 
ah'eady too late. The coalmen who had raced to the 
alley of Deux-Cent-Quarante, as if chased by the crash- 
ing of the tubbing, had terrified the families, and bands 
of women, old men and children came running down, 
shaken by screams and sobs. They had to be driven 
back. A cordon of guards was charged to look after 
them, for they would have interfered with the work. 
Many workmen who had come from the shaft remained 
there stupefied, withont wishing to go and change their 
clothing, held by a fascination of fear in front of that 
frightful hole in which they had been so near remaining. 
The mothers, the wives, hung around them, begging 
them, questioning them, demanding the names. Was 
this one down there? and that one? and that other? 
They did not know, they stammered. They shivered 
and made foolish gestures, gestures which told of a hor- 
rible vision always before them. The crowd augmented 
rapidly. A lamentation went up in the roads. And 
there outside, seated in the shed belonging to Bonne- 
mort, was a man, Jouvarine, who did not keep himself 
at a distance, but who looked on. 

"■ The names! the names! " cried the women in voices 
choked with tears. 

Megrel ajjpeared an instant, saying: 

'^As soon as we find out the names we will let you 
know. But no one is lost, every one will be saved. I 
am going down." 

Then mute with anguish, the crowd waited. In re- 
ality; with a quiet bravery the engineer got ready to 
descend. He unbolted the cage, gave the order to put 
it in place at tlie end of the cable; and as he feared that 
the water would extinguish his lamp, he attached an- 
other under the bottom of the cage. 

Some trembling overseers, with white facesand discom- 
posed, assisted in these preparations. 

" You can descend with me, Dansaert/' said Megrel 
in a brave voice. 

Then when he saw them all without courage, when 
he saw the superintendent staggering, drunk with fear, 
he broke out with a gesture of scorn. 



384 GERMINAL. 

"■' 'No, you bother me. ... I would rather be 
alone. '^ 

He had already stepped into the straight basket which 
balanced itself at the end of the cable, and holding in 
one hand a lamp, pressing with the other the signal cord, 
he himself cried to the engineer: 

"Slowly." 

The engine started. Mcgrel disappeared in the 
abyss, from which continually arose the howls of the 
miserable people. At the top no one stirred. He 
ascertained the good condition of the upper tubbing. 
Suspended in empty space, he turned round and lit up 
the walls: the leakages between the joints were so 
abundant that his lamp was not sufficient. But, at 
three hundred metr» s, when he arrived at the lower 
tubbing, just as he expected, a sudden stream put out 
his lamp. From this distance he no longer had any 
light, except the hanging-lamp which preceded him 
into the darkness. And, in spite of his temerity, he 
shivered and grew pale in the face of the horror of the 
disaster. A few pieces of wood alone remained; the 
others had given way with their supports behind; an 
enormous cavity yawned; the yellow sand, as fine as 
meal, ran in considerable masses; while the water of 
the torrent of that subterranean sea, with its temjDCsts 
and its wrecks, unknown, was flowing in like a mill- 
dam. He still descended, lost in the midst of this 
chaos, which increased constantly, beaten about and 
turned round and round under the waterspout, so badly 
lit up by the small lamp going down below him that he 
believed he distinguished some streets, some squares of 
destroyed cities, afar off in the sport of the great mov- 
ing shadows. Work was no longer jiossible. He only 
cherished one hope — that of being able to save the 
imperiled men. In a measure, as he descended, he 
heard the shouts grow louder. But he was obliged to 
pause; an insuj)erable obstacle barred the shaft — a heap 
of timbers, parts of the guides, pieces broken from the 
ladders entangled with broken pieces of the pump. It 
would take eight days to clear away the passage. And, 
after examining it for a long time, his heart almost 
burst at abandoning these miserable people, whose 
screams had suddenly ceased. The flood had filled 



GERMINAL. 385 

their mouths, and they had hastened to go further up 
the roads before the rapid rise of the water. 

Then Megrel drew the signal cord to be taken up. 
But he paused again, stupefied at that sudden catastro- 
phe of whicli he could not comprehend the cause. He 
wished to take notice of it; he examined the pieces of 
tubbing wliich still held. At a distance some rents, 
some cuts in the wood, surprised him. As his lamp was 
flickering, drenched by the water, he desired to touch 
these places with his fingers, and he very surely felt the 
notches of a saw, the blows of a wimble; it was all the 
abominable work of destruction. Evidently some one 
had desired that catastrophe. He was dumbfounded; 
the other pieces were cracking, falling down with their 
supports in a terrible slide, which threatened even to 
carry him witli them. The courage to go down there, 
the thouglit of the man who had done that, running 
such risks, froze him with a holy horror of the wickedness, 
as if, mingled with the shadows, the m.an were still 
there, monstrous on account of his unparalleled act. 
He cried out, he shook the signal with a furious hand; 
it seemed a long time, for he perceived, a hundred 
metres higher, that the upper tubbing was also com- 
mencing to give way; the joints were opening and be- 
ginning to stream with water. It was now only a 
question of hours; the shaft would be finished by be- 
coming flooded and then fall to pieces. 

At the top M. Hennebeau anxiously awaited Megrel. 

"Well! what is it? "he asked. But the engineer, 
strangled, could not speak. He had failed. 

" It is not possible; that cannot be. Have you exam- 
ined? " 

With a defiant look he nodded his head, yes. He re- 
fused to explain in the presence of some overseers who 
were listening; he led his uncle a short distance off, and, 
very low in his ear, he at length whispered: The boards 
were filled with holes and sawed; the mine had been 
bled at its throat and had given the death rattle. Be- 
coming pale, the director also lowered his voice in an 
instinctive wish to be silent upon the monstrosity of the 
great crime. It was useless' to tremble before the ten 
thousand workmen of Moutson; later on they would see. 
And both continued 1 d whisper, startled that a man 
25 



38G GERMINAL. 

had found the courage to descend, to suspend himself 
in the midst of that space, to risk his life twenty times 
in that frightful work. They did not even comprehend 
such foolish bravery in destruction; they refused to be- 
lieve in spite of the evidence, as one doubts those tales 
of celebrated escapes of prisoners disappearing from 
windows at thirty metres from the ground. 

When M. Hennebeau again approached tlie overseer, 
a nervous twitching drew up his face. He gave a de- 
sparing gesture and then ordered that the mine be 
cleared at once. It was the mournful departure after 
a burial, a mute abandonment with backward glances 
upon that great body of bricks, empty and still stand- 
ing, which nothing could save. 

And when the director and engineer last of all de- 
scended to the receiver's office the crowd gathered around 
them, obstinately repeating: 

" The names! the names! tell us the names.'' 
Poor la Mahcu was there, among the wives and 
mothers. She remembered the noise in the night, her 
daughter and lodger gone off together; they were surely 
at the bottom; and after having cried that it served 
them right, that they deserved to remain there, the 
heartless ones, the cowards, she ran forward and placed 
herself in the first row shivering with agony. How- 
ever, she dared no longer doubt; the discussion v/hich 
was raised around her about the names convinced her. 
Yes, yes, Catherine was there, Etienne also — a comrade 
had seen them. But they no longer agreed as to the 
others. Coming out one of the first, Zacharie, in spite 
of his mocking nature, had with tears in his eyes em- 
braced his v;ife and mother; and standing near the 
latter he trembled with her, showing for his sister an 
until then unknown tenderness, refusing to believe her 
dov/n there, even though all the chiefs should officially 
affirm it. 

"The names! the names! please tell us the names!" 
Megrel, unnerved, said in a high key to the overseer: 
" Make them be silent. We do not know their 
names." 

Two hours had already passed. In the first fright no 
one had thought of the other shaft at the old mine of 
Requiîlart. M. Hennebeau was saying that they would 



GEKMIXAL. 387 

try the tubbing on that side, when a rumor ran rou7id 
that live workmen had just escaped drowning by com- 
ing up by tlie rotten steps of the old unused ladders; 
and they named old Moque, which caused surprise, for 
no one had believed him at the bottom. But the tale 
of the five redoubled their fears; thirteen workmen had 
not been able to follow them, wild, walled in by tlie 
cave-in; and it was no longer possible to go to them, 
for there was already ten metres of water in Eequillart. 
They knew all the names now; the air was filled with 
the groans of the stricken people. 

'* Make them be silent,^' said Megrel, furious. ''And 
send them all back. Yes, yes, a hundred metres. There 
is danger; be quiet, be quiet.'' 

He wished to fight against the miserable people. 
They imagined other trials; they were trying to conceal 
the dead; and the overseers were obliged to explain 
to them that the shaft would fill the entire mine. 
That thought made them mute with fear; and they 
finally allowed themselves to be pushed back step 
by step; but they were compelled to double tlie guards 
who held them back; for in spite of themselves, as if 
drawn forward, tlsey always came back. A thousand 
])ersons pushed each other on the road; they had run 
from all the alleys, even from Montson. And the man 
on the hill, the blond man with the face of a girl, 
smoking his cigarette to render him patient, never took 
his large clear eyes from the mine. 

Then the waiting commenced. It was noon, no one 
had eaten, and no one went away. In the smoky sky 
of a dirty gray slowly passed the dark clouds. A great 
dog, behind the hedge in Rasseneur's yard, constantly 
barked, irritated no doubt by the hot" breaths of the 
crowd. And that crowd little by little sunk back into 
the neighboring grounds, making a circle around the 
mine at a hundred metres. In the center of that great 
ring the Voreux arose. No life, no sound, a desert; 
windows and doors remained open, showing the aban- 
doned interior; a forgotten cat scented the warning in 
that solitude and jumped from a stairway and disap- 
peared. Without doubt the fires of the boilers were 
scarcely extinguished, for the higli brick chimney threw 
out some slight smoke upon the dark clouds ; while the 



388 aïïRMINAL. 

vane in the tower, wrenched by the wind, gave a small 
shrill cry, the only melancholy voice in those vast build- 
ings, v/hich were dying. 

At two o'clock no one had stirred. M. Hennebeau, 
Megrel and the other engineers ran around, making a 
group of overcoats and black hats before the people; 
they no longer delayed, their limbs nearly exhausted 
with fatigue, feverish, anxious, sick at heart, wishing 
to assist, but powerless in such a disaster, they only 
sj)oke occasional words in a low voice, as if at a death- 
bed. 

The upper tubbing would give way in the end. 
Sudden reverberations were heard, jerking noises of 
heavy falls, succeeded by long silence. ■ It was the ever 
widening wound; the breaking up commenced below 
was mounting to the surface. Megrel was seized with 
nervous impatience; he wished to see, and he had al- 
ready advanced alone into this frightful cavity, when he 
was taken by the shoulders and drawn back. What 
was the good of it? He could prevent nothing. Never- 
theless, an old miner, escaping the vigilance of the 
guard, had run to the waiting room; but he reai)peared 
calmly; he had gone to look for his sabots. 

Three o'clock struck. Nothing yet. A shower had 
soaked the crowd without moving them a step. Rasse- 
neur's dog had recommenced to bark. And it was only 
at twenty minutes past three that a first shock made the 
ground tremble. The Voreux shuddered at it, firm and 
upright. But a second shock followed immediately, 
and a long cry issued from the open mouths; the tarred 
screening-shed, after tottering twice, had just fallen 
with a terrible crash. Under the enormous pressure, 
the planks broke up and struck against each other with 
such power that sparks flew out. From this moment 
the ground did not cease trembling, the shocks suc- 
ceeded each other, subterranean sinkings with the rum- 
bling of a volcano in a state of eruption. In the distance, 
the dog no longer barked, he howled an appeal, as if he 
would announce the oscillations whose approach he felt; 
and the women, the children, all these people looking 
on, could hardly restrain a cry of distress at each shock. 
In less than ten minutes the slated roof of the belfry 
gave way, the receiver's room and the engine-room fell 



GERMINAL. 389 

in, making a considerable breach. Then the noises 
ceased, tlie caving-in stopped; there was profound 
silence, and all was motionless. For an hour the 
Voreux remained thus, attacked, bombarded as if by an 
army of barbarians. Cries were no longer heard, the 
widened circle of sjiectators looked on silently shudder- 
ing. 

Under the beams piled up by the wreck could be 
distinguished the broken and twisted hoppers. But 
especially at the receiver's office the debris accumulated 
in the midst of a shower of bricks and portions of the 
walls which fell in the rubbish. The high ironwork 
which held the drums had given way, and was already 
half buried under the ruins; a cage had remained hung 
at the end of a twisted cable, which swung to and fro; 
then there was a mixture of cars, flagging and ladders. 
By chance the lamp room had remained intact, showing 
on the left its clear rows of little lamps. And at the 
end of that destroyed room one could see the engine, 
squarely placed upon its massive stonework; the met- 
als shining, the great steel arms having the appearance 
of indestructible muscles; the enormous crank standing 
up in the air resembling the powerless knee of a giant 
sleeping and tranquil in its strength. 

M. Hennebeau, at the end of that hour of respite, 
calmed a little, and felt a new-born hope. The move- 
ment of the ground would terminate, they would then 
have a chance to save the engine and the rest of the 
buildings. But he always resisted when they approach- 
ed to talk with him, he wished to wait a half-hour 
more. The waiting became insupportable; hope re- 
doubled the agony; every heart beat furiously. A dark 
cloud enlarged upon the horizon, hastening the twiliglit, 
and a sinister day closed upon that waif of the tempests 
of the earth. They had been there for seven hours 
without moving, without eating; in such a nightmare 
that no one was longer conscious of the others nor of 
himself. 

Suddenly, when the engineers decided to advance, a 
powerful convulsion of the earth made them flee. Sub- 
terranean detonations broke out like a monstrous ar- 
tillery cannonading the abyss. On the surface the last 
remaining structures were thrown down and broken to 



390 GERMINAL. 

pieces. First a sort of whirlwind carried away the 
debris of the screening shed and the receiver's office. 
The boiler rooms burst open and at last disappeared. 
Then, in the square tower, the hoisting engine rattled 
and fell upon its face like a man cut down by a bullet. 
And they then saw a frightful spectacle; the engine 
was wrenched from its massive foundation; its arms 
were quartered as if striving against death; it fell off 
with its crank, its giant knee loosened as if by a 
lever; it expired crushed, swallowed up. Only the 
chimney, thirty metres high, still remained standing, 
trembling like a death in a hurricane. They thought 
it would crumble and fly into powder; but all at once 
it sank down like a stone swallowed up by the earth, 
suddenly melting down like a colossal cierge; and 
nothing was left, not even the point of the lightning- 
rod. It was finished; that horrid beast, crouching in 
that hollow stuffed with human flesh, no longer 
breathed its great, long breath. The entire Voreux had 
sank into the abyss. 

The yelling crowd saved themselves. Women ran 
with hands held over tlieir eyes. In fear, the men dis- 
appeared away like a heap of dry leaves blown by the 
wind. They did not wish to scream, but they did 
scream, with arms boating the air, before that immense 
hole, which constantly grew larger, that crater of a 
sleeping volcano, fifteen metres deep, extending out on 
the canal road for forty metres at the least. The whole 
square of the mine followed the buildings — the gigantic 
tressles; the tramways, with their rails; a complete train 
of cars, three wagons, without counting the stock of 
timber — a huge load of cut trees, which were swallowed 
up like straws. At the bottom, they could no longer 
distinguish anything but a confusion of rubbish, iron,, 
bricks, plaster in horrible piles, entangled, dirty in the 
fierce wrath of the catastrophe. The chasm extended. 
Some deep cracks v/ere made in boards away off in the 
distance across the fields. A flying piece of wood went 
as far as Rasseneur's, and cracked the front of the house. 
Was even the alley to be destroyed? Wliere would they 
flee for shelter at the end of tliis abominable day. under 
that cloud of lead, which also seemed to hide the 
people? 



GERMIÏTAL. 391 

Megrel cried ont with grief. M. Hennebeau was 
weeping. The disaster was not complete, a barge at the 
bridge broke in pieces, and the canal was quickly 
thrown into a boiling sheet, in one of the fissures. Is 
disappeared; it fell like a cataract into a bottomless ra- 
vine. The mine drank up that river, the inundation 
would now flood the galleries for years. Soon the cra- 
ter filled itself; a lake of muddy water occupied the 
place where was lately the Voreux, like those lakes un- 
der which sleep horrible villages. A terrified silence 
fell; nothing was longer heard but the sound of that 
water, rolling on in the bowels of the earth. 

Then, on that shaking ground, Jouvarine arose. In 
the distance he had recognized la Maheu and Zacli- 
arie, their faces bloody, in fi'ont of the sinking which 
perhaps pressed upon the heads of the miserable people 
who were agonizing at the bottom. He threw away 
his last cigarette and started off without a look behind 
in the night now becoming dark. In the distance, his 
shadow diminished, and was lost in the darkness. He 
went on, with his tranquil air, to exterminate wherever 
dynamite could be found to blow up cities and men. 
It would be he, doubtless, when the expiring peasantry 
should hear beneath them an explosion of the pavement 
at each step. 



CHAPTER XXXVIII. 

On" the night which followed the destruction of the 
Voreux, M. Hennebeau started for Paris, wishing to give 
personal information to the managers before the news- 
papers even could publish the news. When he returned 
the next day, he was to be found very calm, very pale, 
with the look of an upright superintendent. He had 
evidently relieved himself from responsibility; his 
favor did not appear to have diminished ; on the con- 
trary, the decree naming him an officer of the Legion of 
Honor was signed twenty-four hours after. But, if the 
director remained safe, the company had just received 
a terrible blow. It was not the loss of a few millions, 
it was the wound in the flank, the dumb and ceaseless 
4read of the morrov/, after the choking up of one of 



393 GEEMINAL. 

their shafts. They were so stricken that once more they 
felt the need of silence. AVliat was the good of stirring 
up this horrible matter? Why, if the villain should be 
discovered, make a martyr whose frightful heroism 
would kindle other brains and give birth to a brood of 
incendiaries and assassins. Besides, they had no sus- 
picion of the real culprit ; they settled down to a belief 
in a host of accomplices, unable to admit that a single 
man could have had the audacity and the strength for 
such a task ; and it was just that thought that absorbed 
them, that thought of an ever growing menace around 
their mines. 

The director had been ordered to organize a vast sys- 
tem of secret surveillance, then quietly to dismiss, one 
by one, any dangerous men sus])ected of complicity in 
the crime. They contented themselves with this mode 
of purging, from high considerations of political pru- 
dence. There was but one immediate dismissal, that 
of Dansaert, the superintendent. Since the scandal at 
la Pierronne^s, he had become unbearable. And the 
pretext was found in his conduct at the time of the 
catastrophe, his cowardice as a captain deserting his 
men. Besides, it was a discreet concession to the 
miners, who hated him. Nevertheless, rumors were 
afloat among the public, and the owners had sent a note 
in rectification to a journ;d, denying a version mention- 
ing a barrel of powder, lighted by the strikers. 
Already, after a rapid investigation, the report of the 
government engineer announced the natural breaking 
up of the tubbing, occasioned by the piling up of the 
earth as the cause; and the company had preferred to 
accept in silence the blame for want of care. With the 
Parisian press, after the third day, the falling in of the 
mine had taken its place in the general news; nothing 
was talked of but the dying workmen underground, 
and the published dispatches were eagerly read every 
morning. Even at Montson, the peasantry paled and 
became speechless even at the word Voreux. A vague 
rumor was floating about which even the boldest trem- 
bled to whisper. The whole country around was filled 
with pity for the victims; walking parties to the de- 
stroyed mine were organized, families hurried there to 



GEKMINAL. 393 

see the dreadful ruins, pressing down so heavily on the 
heads of the wretched men entombed. 

Deneuliu, apjoointed engineer of the division, had 
come into office in the midst of the great disaster, and 
his first care had been to force tlie canal back to its bed, 
for this torrent of water spreading over the bottom of the 
mine aggravated the damage every hour. Great labor 
was required; he had immediately placed a hundred work- 
men at the construction of a dike. Twice the impetu- 
osity of the stream had carried away the first dams. 
Now, pumps had been fixed; it was a hard fight, a violent 
struggle for repossession, step by step, of this corner of 
earth. 

But the salvation of the buried miners was still more 
engrossing. Megrel was ag?in entrusted to make 
another supreme effort, and arms were not wanting him; 
all the coalmen rushed to offer themselves in a burst of 
fraternity. They forgot the strike, they did not trouble 
themselves about the pay; they asked for nothing, they 
only asked to risk their lives when comrades were in 
peril. They were all there with their implements, 
shivering, waiting to be told at what point to begin. 
Many, ill from friglit after tlie accident, agitated by 
nervous trembling, bathed in cold perspiration, pos- 
sessed by incessant nightmares, got up notwithstanding, 
and seemed among the most courageous of those bat- 
tling with the earth as if they had a revenge to take. 
Only there was some embarassment when the utility of 
this work was questioned; what was to be done? how 
were they to get down? on what side were they to 
attack the stones? 

It was Megrel's opinion that not one of the unfortu- 
nate men survived; the fifteen had certainly perished, 
either drowned or asphyxiated; but in these mining 
catastrophes the rule was always to consider the im- 
mured men at the bottom as living, and he reasoned on 
this principle. The first question which he asked 
himself was to know where they could have taken re- 
fuge. The overseers, the old miners, when consulted 
by him, agreed on this point; their comrades, after the 
flooding had certainly ascended from gallery to gallery, 
as far as tlie highest boards, so that they ought now to 
be gathered at the end of one of the superior roads. 



394 GERMIÎ^TAL. 

This, besides, agreed with the information given by- 
old iVEouque, whose confused recital would even make 
one believe that the widening of the leak had separated 
the band into little groups, scattering the fugitives on 
the road at each level. Then the opinions of the over- 
seers were divided in the discussion of the attempts 
which might be made. As the roads nearest to the sur- 
face were at a distance of one hundred and eighty 
metres, it would not be feasible to sink a shaft. The 
only entrance remaining was through Eequillart, the 
only point at v/hich it could be approached. Unfortu- 
nately the old mine, also inundated, no longer com- 
municated with the Voreux, and nothing remained free 
above the level of the waters but certain- fragments of 
the galleries belonging to the first shaft-room. The 
draining would take years; the best advice, therefore, 
was to visit these galleries carefully to see if they were 
not in the vicinity of the submerged roads, at the end 
of wliich they suspected the impiisoned miners might 
be found. 

Before arriving at this logical conclusion, there had 
been much discussion of a number of impracticable 
suggestions. Megrel then shook the dust from the 
archives, and, when he had found the old plans of the 
two mines, studied them and determined at what points 
the researches should be made. Gradually, this hunt 
excited him; he, in his turn, was seized with a fever of 
self-devotion, in spite of his ironical indifference toward 
men and things. The first difficulties were encountered 
in descending at Eequillart. Tliey had to clear away 
the mouth of the shaft, cut down the sorb tree, raze the 
phmtainsand hawthorns; and they had besides to repair 
the ladders. Then the groping about commenced. 
The engineer, having gone down with ten workmen, 
made them knock with their picks against certain rocks 
which he designated; and in profound silence, each 
holding his ear to the stone, listening to see if no dis- 
tant stroke responded. But in vain all the practicable 
galleries were traversed; no echo came. The difficulty 
increased. Where should they cut away the bed? 
Toward whom sliould they go, when nobody appeared 
to be there? But they persisted obstinately in the 
search, with ever increasing anxiety. 



GEEMIÎTAL. 395 

Since the first day, la Maheu had come in the 
morning to Requillart. Seated in front of the shaft, 
on a beam, she never stirred till night. When a man 
came out again, she got up, questioning him with her 
eyes, '^ Nothing? — no, nothing! " And she would re-seat 
herself, still waiting, without a word, her face hard and 
inflexible. Jeanlin, also, seeing that his retreat was 
being invaded, wandered around with the frightened 
look of a beast of prey whose ravages are about to be 
disclosed by the terrier. He thouglit of the little sol- 
dier lying under the stones, fearing that his sound sleep 
might be disturbed. But this part of the mine was 
invaded by tlie waters; and, besides, the search was 
directed more to the left, in the west gallery. 

At first Philomêne used to come also, to accompany 
Zacharie, who was one of the exploring party; then she 
became weary of taking cold unnecessarily and without 
any result; she remained in the alley, dragging on her 
days in listless idleness, and coughing from morning 
till night. Zacharie, on the contrary, could not be 
said to live; he would have eaten the ground to recover 
his sister. He cried out in the night; he saw her; he 
heard her, attenuated by hunger, splitting her throat 
in calling for help. Twice he had wished to dig with- 
out orders, saying that he felt that was the place. The 
engineer would not allow him to go down any more, 
and he would not leave the shaft from which they had 
driven him; he could not even sit down and wait near 
his mother, impelled by a desire for ceaseless action. 

At the end of three days Megrel in despair had 
resolved to abandon everything that evening. At 
noon, after lunch, v/hen he had returned with his men 
to undertake a last effort, he was surprised to see 
Zacharie come from the mine, very red, gesticulating, 
and crying: 

"She is there! she has answered me! Come on, 
come on, now!" 

He had slipped upon the ladders, in spite of the 
guard, and he swore that they had knocked, there 
below, in the first road of the vein Guillaume. 

"But we have already passed twice where you say," 
said Megrel, incredulous. "But at any rate we will go 
and see."' 



396 GERMINAL. 

La MaheiT, shivering, had risen, and it was neces- 
sary to use force to prevent her from descending. She 
stood waiting, at the edge of the shaft, looking down 
into the darkness of that hole. 

Below, Megrel himself struck three blows, wide apart; 
then he applied his ear to the coal, commandingthe work- 
men to be silent. ISi'ot a sound did he hear; he shook 
his head; evidently the poor boy was dreaming. Furious, 
Zacharie knocked; and he again heard, his eyes shone, 
his limbs trembled with joy. Then the other workmen 
tried their experience, one after the other; they all be- 
came animated by plainly hearing the distant response. 
The engineer was astonished; he again stuck his ear to 
the coal, and he ended by hearing a slight sound, a 
rythmical rolling, very distinct, the known cadence of 
the miners' call when they beat against the coal, in any 
danger. The coal transmitted the sounds with the 
clearness of crystal, though very distant. An overseer 
who was there estimated that a block of at least fifty 
metres separated them from their companions. But it 
seemed as though they were already able to take their 
comrades' hands; they at once became cheerful. Megrel 
immediately commenced the work of approach. 

When Zacharie, at the top, returned to la Maheu, 
they embraced each other. 

"You needn't hold up your heads yet," said la Pier- 
ronne cruelly, who had come there out of curiosity. "If 
Catherine is not there, that would make you all the 
more unhappy." 

It was true, Catherine was not there, perhaps. 

"Leave me alone, will you!" cried Zacharie, in a 
rage. "She is there; I know it." 

La Maheu had again seated herself, mute, firm and 
motionless. And she again began her weary waiting. 

As soon as the story was circulated in Montson a new 
crowd of people arrived. Tliey could see nothing, but 
they remained there all the same. It was even neces- 
sary to hold the most curious at a distance. Below they 
worked day and night. For fear of meeting with some 
obstacle the engineer had opened in the vein three 
lower galleries, and then worked them all toward the 
point where he supposed the miners to be shut up. A 
single miner worked to break away the coal upon the 



GERMIKAL. 397 

straight front of the long narrow slit. They relieved 
each other every two hours, and the coal with which 
they filled the baskets was taken out by the hands of a 
chain of men which extended itself in 2)roi')ortion as 
the hole increased. The work at first went on very 
rapidly. They took away six metres in one day. 

Zacharie had been put among the workmen who were 
set at clearing away. It was a post of honor for which 
they disputed with each other. And he became angry 
when they wished to relieve him, after his two hours of 
regulated work. He stole the turn of his comrades; 
he refused to lay down his pick. His tunnel was soon 
in advance of the two others; he struck against the 
coal with a blow so terrible that they heard his heavy 
breathing coming from the opening like the blast of 
some interior forge. When he came out, muddy and 
black, drunk with fatigue, he fell on the ground and 
they were obliged to wrap him up. Then, staggering 
off again, he once more replunged into the opening and 
then commenced at once with the great heavy blows 
and the stifled breath, a victorious fight with death. The 
worst was that the coal was becoming hard; twice he 
broke his pick, exasperated at not being able to advance 
so rapidly as before. He also suffered from the heat, 
a heat which increased with each metre that he ad- 
vanced, almost unbearable at the bottom of that small 
hole, where the air could not circulate. A hand venti- 
lator worked well, but the circulation was badly kept 
up; three miners fainted from the heat and were al- 
most strangled by asphyxia. 

Megrel lived at the bottom, with his workmen; they 
sent his meals down to him; he sometimes slept two 
hours, upon a straw couch, covered with a cloak. That 
wliich kept up his courage was the supplications of the 
miserable people there below, the answers growing more 
and more distinct when they beat upon the rock to let 
them know they were hastening to their assistance. 
Now it sounded very distinct, with a musical clearness 
like the striking of a hammer on sonorous glasses. They 
were guided by him and they went on toward that clear 
sound as they would march to tjie cannon in battle. 

Each time that a digger was relieved, Megrel descended 
and tapped, then held down his car, and eacli time, up 



398 GERMINAL. 

to the present, the response had come, rapid and urgent. 
Not a doubt remained to him now, they were advancing 
in the right direction ; but what fatal slowness ! They 
would never arrive quickly enough. At first, in two 
days they had dug through thirteen metres ; but on the 
third day they had only done five ; then on the fourth, 
four ; the coal was so firm, wedged in so strong, that 
now they could scarcely dig out two metres. The ninth 
day, after superhuman efforts, they had advanced thirty- 
two, metres and they calculated that they still had 
twenty before them. 

For the prisoners, it was the twelfth day v&gt;'hich had 
commenced, a dozen twenty-four hours v/ithout bread, 
without fire in those icy shadows. That terrible thought 
wet their eyelashes, and stiffened their arms to the 
work. It seemed, impossible that Christians could live 
longer; the distant blows had been growing weaker 
since the day before; they trembled at each instant that 
they should hear them stop. 

Eegularly la Maheu came to scat herself at the 
mouth of the shaft. She carried Estelle in her arms, 
for the child could not remain alone from morning 
until night. From hour to hour she was informed of 
the work below; she followed their toils; she experienced 
their hopes and their fears. It was, amid the groups 
stationed there and as far as Montson, an expectant 
waiting with endless comments on the least circum- 
stance. The hearts of the entire country beat there 
under the earth. 

The ninth day, at lunch time, Zacharie did not reply 
when they called him to be relieved. He acted as 
though he was crazy, and at last ended by swearing at 
them. At the moment Megrel, who had gone out for 
an instant, was not there to make him obey, and there 
was only with him an overseer and three miners. With- 
out doubt Zacharie, badly lighted, furious at the waver- 
ing light which retarded his work, had committed the 
imprudence of opening his lamp. They had been given 
strict orders on that point, for the fire-damp was great 
there. The gas remained in enormous quantity in 
these straight openings, deprived of ventilation. Sud- 
denly a blast of thunder broke out. A stream of fire 
came from the slit as if from the mouth of a cannon 



GERMIFAL. 399 

charged with grape shot. Everythiug flamed. The air 
was kindled as if from powder from one side of the gal- 
leries to the otlier. The torrent of flame carried away 
the overseer, and three workmen ascended the shaft, 
flashing out into the open day like an eruption whicli 
cracked the rocks and the debris of the works. The 
curious ones fled. La Malieu arose and pressed to 
her breast frightened Estelle. 

When Megrel and the workmen returned a terrible 
rage shook them. They beat the ground with their 
heels, as if a hard-hearted mother had by chance killed 
her children in the imbecile caprices of her cruelty. 
They had devoted themselves to go to the assistance of 
their comrades, and now they had only left there more 
men. At the end of three long hours of efforts and 
dangers, when they had j)enetrated at last into the gal- 
leries, the removal of the victims was sorrowful. Neither 
the overseers nor the workmen were dead, but they were 
terribly wounded, while they could smell their broiled 
flesh; they had swallowed the fire, the burns were even 
in their throats; and they moaned continually, praying 
that they would put an end to their sufferings by kill- 
ing them. Of the three miners one was the man who 
during the strike had crushed the engine with one blow 
of the hammer; the two others still kept the marks on 
their hands where they had cut themselves in throwing 
bricks at the soldiers. The crowed, all pale and shiv- 
ering, uncovered their heads as they were carried past 
them.. 

Standing, la Maheu waited. The body of Zacharie 
at length appeared. The clothing was burned, the body 
was but a l)lack piece of coal, unrecognizable. Crushed 
in tlie explosion, the head was no longer there. And 
when they had placed this frightful remnant of the 
young man on a litter, la Maheu followed them with 
a mechanical step, her eyelids burning, and without a 
tear. She held the slumbering Estelle in her arms, and 
with hair flying in the wind she went off. At the alley, 
Philomene was stupefied; her eyes changed into foun- 
tains which at once relieved her. But tlie mother had 
already returned with the same step to Requillart; she 
had accompanied her son, she now returned there to 
wait for her daughter. 



400 GERMINAL. 

Three days more passed away. They had resumed 
the work iu the midst of unheard of difficulties. The 
galleries to the approach were hajipily not filled up 
from the explosion of fire-damp, only the air burned 
there, vitiated to such a degree, that it was necessary to 
put in other ventilators. Now every twenty minutes the 
miners were relieved. They had advanced within two 
metres of their comrades. Meanwhile they worked on 
with chilled hearts, digging hard as if out of vengeance, 
for the sounds had ceased, the answer no longer sounded 
its little clear cadence. They had been working for 
twelve days, it was uqw fifteen days after the catas- 
trophe, and since morning a silence of death had fallen. 

The new accident had increased the curiosity of the 
Montson people; the wealthy persons organized excur- 
sions with such ardor that the Gregoires decided to fol- 
low the fashion. They made uj) a party; it was 
arranged that they should go to the Voreux in their 
carriage, while Madame Hennebeau, with Lucie and 
Joanne, would join them there. Deneulin would take 
them to visit the ruins, then they would all go back 
together by way of Ecquillart, where Megrel would 
inform them how he was getting along and if there was 
any hope. Then in the evening they would all dine 
together. 

When about three o'clock the Gregoires and their 
daughter Cécile arrived before the sinking mine they 
found Madame Hennebeau had reached the spot before 
them, in a navy-blue toilet and sheltered from the sun of 
February by a lace parasol. The sky was pale and the 
day had the warmth of spring. Just then M. Hennebeau 
and Deneulin came up and she listened with a distrait 
ear to the ex^^lanations which the latter was giving her 
upon the efforts which they had been compelled to make 
to dam up the canal. Jeanne, who always carried her 
sketch book with her, had started to draw, enthusiastic 
over the horror of the subject; while Lucie, seated 
beside her on the debris of a Avagon, also gave some 
exclamations of satisfaction, finding it " épatant. '^ The 
dike, still incomplete, left numerous pieces of the 
wreck, from which the floods of scum rolled up, falling 
in a cascade in the enormous hole of the swallowed 
shaft. However, the crater wa? becoming empty; the 



GERMINAL. 401 

water drunk up by the earth displayed the frightful 
wreck at the bottom. Under the azure sky of that 
beautiful day, it was a sink; the ruins of a city swal- 
lowed up and lost in the mud. 

"And persons put themselves out to see this!^' cried 
M. Grégoire, disenchanted. 

Cécile, very gay, happy at breathing the pure air, 
joked and laughed, while Madame Hennebeau gave a 
look of repugnance, murmuring; 

*' It is a fact — there is nothing pretty about this." 

The two engineers laughed. They tried to interest 
the visitors, taking them to walk, and explaining the 
working of the pumps and the manœuvre of the plug- 
ging which stopped up the pile. But the ladies became 
uneasy. They shivered when they knew that the pumps 
must be operated for years — six, seven years, perhaps — 
before the shaft could be reconstructed, and before they 
had exhausted all the water in the mine. No, they 
liked better to think of other things — those cave-ins 
were only fit to give them horrible dreams. 

" Let us go," said Madame Hennebeau, turning to- 
ward her carriage. 

Jeanne and Lucie cried out, '^What! so soon!" 
And the sketch was not finished! They would remain; 
their father would bring them to the dinner, in the 
evening. M. Hennebeau got in the carriage with his 
wife, for he also wished to question Megrel. From one 
moment to the other they expected to hear that the 
galleries were connected. 

"Very well! go on before," said M. Grégoire. **We 
will follow you; we wish to make a five-minute visit in 
the alley. Go on, go on; we will be at Eequillart as 
soon as you." 

He had already made Madame Grégoire and Cécile 
seat themselves in -the carriage, and, while the other 
vehicle went along the canal-road, theirs slowly as- 
cended the hill. 

It was a thought of charity with which they wished 
to complete the excursion. The death of Zacharie had 
filled them with pity for the Maheu family, of whom so 
many had been killed. They did not feel for the 
father — that robber, that killer of soldiers — who it had 
been necessary to beat down like a wolf. Only the 
26 



402 GERMIKAL. 

mother touched them; that poor woman who had just 
lost her son after having lost her husband, and whose 
daughter was perhaps only a corpse under the earth; 
without counting the infirm grandfather, the boy- 
lamed by a cave-in, and the little girl who died from 
hunger and cold during the strike. Of course that 
family had in part merited their unhappiness by their 
detestable spirit; but they wished to show the largeness 
of their charity, their desire for forgetfulness and re- 
conciliation, and they themselves were carrying them 
alms. Two bundles, carefully wrapped up, were in a 
basket in the carriage. 

An old woman told them where the Maheu's house 
was, number sixteen on the second row. But when the 
Gregoires got down with their bundles they knocked in 
vain, and at last they knocked on the door with their 
fists but received no response, the house sadly reechoed 
like a place empty from death, cold and dark, aban- 
doned for a long time. 

*' There is no one here," said Cécile, disappointed. 
" Is it not too bad after all the trouble we have taken?" 

Suddenly the next door opened and la Levaque ap- 
peared. • 

"Oh! Monsieur and Madame, a thousand pardons! 
Excuse me, mademoiselle! . . . It is the neighbor 
that you wish. She is not here; she is at Eequillart." 

In a flood of words she told them the tale, explaining 
that she had aided her as much as she could by keeping 
Lenore and Henri to permit the mother to go to the 
old mine. She glanced at the bundles and she now 
spoke of the poor girl who had become a widow, to show 
off her own misery, her eyes glistening with covetous- 
ness. Then with a hesitating air she murmured: 

" I've got the key. If Monsieur and Madame will 
enter; the grandfather is there." 

The Gregoires, stupefied, looked at her. How ! the 
grand-father was there ! but no one had replied. Was 
he asleep ? And when la Levaque opened the door 
what they saw made them pause at the threshold. 

Bonnemort was there alone, his eyes fixed and large, 
riveted upon a chair before the cold cliimney. Around 
him, the room appeared larger, without the clock and 
the furniture, of varnished pine which had formerly 



GERMINAL. 403 

enlivened it ; there only remained on the damp walls 
the portraits of the Emperor and Empress whose red 
lips smiled with an official benevolence. The old man 
did not stir, his eyes red, never moving under the light 
which came in from the open door; with an imbecile 
air he acted as though he had not even seen these people 
enter. At his feet was a plate filled with cinders into 
which he spat. 

" Do not pay any atttention to him, if he is not 
polite," said la Le vaque, obligingly. *' Something's 
wrong with him. He has been like this for half a 
month.'' 

But a convulsion agitated Bonnemort, a deep rattling 
seemed to come from his stomach ; and he again spat in 
the plate, and his spittle turned the cinders into coal 
black mud ; then he again became motionless. He no 
longer moved except to spit. 

Troubled, filled with disgust, the Gregoires tried 
meanwhile to find some amiable and encouraging words. 

*'Well, my good man," said the father, "you have 
the rheumatism, have you not?" 

The old man, his eyes turned to the wall, did not 
move his head. And heavy silence again fell. 

"They should make you a little tisane," added the 
mother. 

He kept his mute silence. 

** Say, papa, " murmured Cécile, " tfiey only said he 
was infirm. They did not tell us this." 

She interrupted herself, very much embarrassed. 
After having placed upon the table a pot-au-feu and 
two bottles of wine, she untied the other package and 
took from it an enormous pair of shoes. This was the 
gift intended for the grandfather, and she remained 
with the shoes in her hand, confused, looking at the 
feet of the poor man who would never walk again. 

"They came a little late, did they not?" my good 
man/' resumed M. Grégoire, **to enliven the situation. 
That is always the case." 

Bonnemort did not hear, did not respond, while his 
frightful looking face was as hard and cold as a stone. 

Then Cécile silently placed the shoes against the 
wall, but as she set them down the nails made a noise. 

"He will not say, thank you." cried la Levaque, who 



404 . GERMINAL. 

had cast a look of profound envy on the shoes. "It's 
like giving a pair of spectacles to a duck, saving your 
respect." 

She continued; she was working to draw the Gre- 
goires into her house, thinking they would be moved 
to pity there. At last she found a pretense; she spoke 
to them of Lenore and Henri, who were very pretty, 
good darlings; and so intelligent, telling their ages, 
and whatever else was asked them. They could tell all 
that monsieur and madame wanted to know. 

"Will you come for an instant, my girl?" said the 
father, happy at going out. 

"Yes; I will come," she replied. 

Cécile remained alone with Bonnemost; trembling 
and fascinated, she thought she remembered that old 
man; where had she met with that square face, pale and 
spotted v&gt;^ith coal? and suddenly she remembered. She 
recalled the crowd of furious people who had pressed 
around her; she felt the cold hands which had clasped 
her throat. She had again found the man; she looked 
at his hands placed on his knees; the hands of a work- 
man, crooked and with all the strength in the fingers. 
Little by little old Bonnemort had appeared to awaken, 
and he perceived her; he examined her also with his 
stupid air. A flame mounted to his cheeks; a nervous 
shock drew ujd his mouth, from which ran a stream of 
black saliva. Attracted, both remained, the one before 
the other; she flourishing, fat and fresh from long idle- 
ness, and from the good living of her race; he, drop- 
sical, and with the disagreeable ugliness of a foundered 
beast, wrecked by a hundred years, from father to son, 
of toil and hunger. 

At the end of ten minutes when the Gregoires, sur- 
prised at not seeing Cécile, returned to the Maheus' 
house, they gave a terrible scream. Upon the floor lay 
their daughter, her face blue, strangled. On her throat 
the enormous thumb had left the red imprint of a 
giant's thumb. Bonnemort, after staggering upon his 
dead limb, had fallen beside her without being able to 
rise again. His hands were still clutched, he looked at 
the people with a vacant stare. In his fall he had 
broken his plate, the cinders were scattered around; 
while the great shoes still leaned against the wall. 



GERMINAL. 405 

It was never possible to establish the exact facts. 
"Why had Cécile approached; how Bonnemort, confined 
to his chair, had been able to take her by the throat. 
Evidently, when he had held her he became maddened, 
always pressing, stifling her cries, struggling with her 
until the last rattle. Not a sound, not a cry had trav- 
ersed the thin partition of the neighboring house. It 
was believed to have been from a sudden freak of mad- 
ness, an inexplainable temptation to murder in the 
pressure of that girl's white throat. Such a savage 
frenzy in that old, infirm man, who had lived a good 
man, an obedient beast opposed to the new ideas. What 
unknown rancor, slowly heated up, had mounted to the 
head? The horror had ended with unconsciousness. 
It was the crime of an idiot. 

Meanwhile, the Gregoires on their knees, wept and 
choked with grief, their adored girl, that child who had 
been so long desired, whom they had watched as she 
slept, whom they had never thought anything good 
enough for! It was the end even of their life; what 
good was it to live now that they must live without 
her? 

La Levaque, hopeless, cried: 

"Ah! the old villain, why did he do that?" And 
la Maheu would only return in the evening! Hadn't 
she better go now and find her? 

Overcome, the father and mother did not respond. 

"Well! it would be better, at any rate. ... I 
will go." 

But before going out la Levaque caught sight of the 
shoes. All the alley was aroused; some curious ones 
were already running at the terrible news. Perhaps 
some one would steal them. And then there was no 
longer a man at the Maheu s to wear them. Softly she 
carried them off. They would do well for Bouteloup. 

At Requillart the Hennebeaus, with Megrel, had 
waited a long time for the Gregoires. The young man 
had come up from the mine and given the news; they 
hoped to communicate that very evening with the 
prisoners; but they would certainly only meet with their 
corpses, for the silence of death continued. Behind 
the engineer la Maheu seated upon a beam was listen- 
ing with pale face when la Levaque arrived to tell her 



406 GERMINAL. 

of the old man's blow. She gave a gesture of impa- 
tience and irritation. However she was obliged to fol- 
low her. 

Madame Hennebeau swooned away. What an abomi- 
nation! Poor Cécile who only that day had been so 
gay, so lively. M. Hennebeau took his fainting wife 
into old Moque's house. With awkward hands he 
brought her to, troubled by the odor of musk which 
came from the opened dress. And when, streaming 
with tears, she clasped in her arms Megrel who was 
shocked by the death which cut short his marriage; the 
husband watched them lament together, free from 
anxiety. This unhappiness would arrange everything; 
he preferred to keep his nephew in the fear of his 
coachman. 



CHAPTEE XXXIX. 



Below the shaft, the unfortunate men shouted with 
terror. The water had now reached their stomachs. 
The noise of the torrent stunned them, the last falls of 
the tubbing made them tliink it the final crash of the 
world; and that which completed their terror was the 
neighing of the horses shut up in the stable, the 
death cry, terrible, never-to-be-forgotten, of a strangled 
animal. 

Mouque had freed Bataille. The old horse was there, 
trembling, with eyes dilated and fixed on that ever ris- 
ing water. The shaft-room was rapidly filling, the 
swelling of the greenish stream could be seen by the red 
light of the three lamps still burning under the roof. 
Suddenly, when he felt the icy flood on his skin, he 
burst away at a furious galoj), engulfed himself and 
was lost to sight at the end of one of the galleries. 
Then it was sauve-qui-peut, the men following the 
animal. 

" The game is up here!" cried Mouque. *' We must 
try by Eequillart." 

This thought, that they might be able to get out by 
the old mine in the vicinity, if they arrived there before 
the passage was cut off, filled them now. The twenty 



GEKMINAL. 407 

hustled together in single file, holding their lamps above 
their heads that the water miglit not extinguish them. 
■ Fortunately, the gallery had a slight though imper- 
ceptible ascent. They proceeded two hundred metres, 
fighting against the flood, but without being overcome. 
Slumbering creeds re-awakened in their lost souls; they 
invoked the earth. It was the earth which was aveng- 
ing itself, pouring out thus the blood of the vein, because 
one of its arteries had been cut. An old man was stam- 
mering forgotten prayers, twirling his thumbs to appease 
the evil spirits of the mine. 

But, at the first flagging, discord broke out. The 
groom wished to turn to the left; others swore that it 
would be shorter to turn to the right. A minute was 
lost. 

"Well! leave your skin there; what do I care!" 
Cheval exclaimed, brutally. " I'm going that way.*' 

He went to the right; his comrades followed him. 
The others continued to run behind old Mouque, who 
had grown up at the bottom of Requillart. Neverthe- 
less, he hesitated himself, not knowing which way to turn. 
They were losing their heads; the old ones no longer 
recognized the roads, the skein becoming confused 
before them. At each division of the roads, uncer- 
tainty stopped them short, but, nevertheless, they must 
decide. 

Etienne was the last to run, delayed by Catherine, 
paralyzed by fear and fatigue. He would have turned 
to the right with Cheval, for he thought it the right 
road, but, willing to remain at the bottom, he had 
drawn back, glad to be freed from the presence of the 
man he execrated. Besides, the separation continued. 
Other comrades had drawn off. Six only now followed 
old Mouque. 

'* Hang on to my neck, I'll carry you," said Etienne 
to the young girl, seeing her grow weaker. 

" No, leave me," she murmured, " I can do no more; 
I'd rather die at once." 

They had stopped, and he was raising her in spite of 
her resistance, when the gallery was suddenly blocked 
up, an enormous heap falling in and separating them 
from the others. The flood already washed rocks, and 
crumblings were heard on all sides. Thus driven back 



408 GERMINAL. 

they had to retrace their steps. Then they knew no 
longer on what side they were walking. It was finished; 
they must abandon the idea of ascending by Eequillart. 
Their only hope was to retreat before the flood, to reach 
the upper levels, whence perhaps they would come to 
deliver them if the waters abated. 

Etienne at last recognized the Guillaume vein. 

" Good! " said he, "I know where we are. My God! 
we were in the right road. . . . Listen! let us go 
straight on, we'll climb up by the chimney. 

The waves beat their breasts; they walked very slowly. 
As long as they had light they would not despair; and 
they extinguished one of the lamps to economize the 
oil, with the intention of emptying it into the others. 
About thirty metres separated them from the chimney 
when a noise behind them made them turn. Could it 
it be that their comrades, barred in their turn, were re- 
turning? A tremendous blast rumbled in the distance; 
they could not understand this tempest approaching 
them in a splashing foam. And they cried out in 
fright when they saw a gigantic whitish mass issue from 
the darkness and struggle to reach them between the 
narrow woodwork which was crushing it. 

It was Bataille. On setting out from the shaft room 
he had galloped through the entire length of the gal- 
leries. He seemed to know his way in this subterran- 
ean city, which he had inhabited for twelve years, and 
he saw clearly in the midst of the eternal night in 
which he had lived. He galloped and galloped, lower- 
ing his head and gathering up his feet, scraping through 
the narrow places which his large frame filled up. The 
roads succeed each other, the levels opened their forks 
without any hesitation from him. Where was he going? 
Over there, perhaps, to the vision of his youth, to the 
mill where he was born, on the banks of the Scarpe, to 
the dim recollection of the sun burning in the sky like 
a large lamp. He wished to live, the memory of the 
animal was awakening; the longing to breathe once 
more the air of the plains urged him straight on until 
he could find the opening under the warm sky, in the 
light. His patience of old gave way in revolt; this 
mine was murdering him after blinding him. The 
water which chased him, whipped his flanks, and clung 



GEEMINAL. 409 

to his back. But the further he penetrated the nar- 
rower seemed the galleries, the roof lower, the walls 
closing in. He galloped on, all the same, his skin 
excoriated, leaving strips of his flesh hanging on the 
wood- work. On all sides the mine seemed to be shut- 
ting him tightly in, to capture and strangle him. 
When Etienne and Catherine, as he drew near them, 
suddenly perceived that he was perishing between the 
rocks. He had reached the end; he had broken both 
front legs. With a last effort he dragged himself a few 
metres; but his flanks could pass no longer, they were 
enveloped, garotted by the earth. And this bleeding 
head stretched out, still seeking a crevice with his large, 
troubled eyes. The water came upon him rapidly, he 
began to neigh, with a prolonged horrible rattle, the 
same which had been heard already at the death of the 
other horses in the stable. It was a frightful death 
agony, this old animal, broken to pieces, unable to stir, 
struggling in these depths far from daylight. His cry 
of distress never ceased, the water floated his mane and 
made him hoarser, with his mouth stretched wide open 
There was a groan, the rumbling noise of a tun filling 
up. Then, profound silence followed. 

*'Ah! my God! take me away," sobbed Catherine. 
"Ah! my God! I'm afraid; I don't want to die. . . . 
Take me away! take me away!" 

She had seen the death. The caving in of the shaft, 
the inundated mine, nothing had struck her with such 
overpowering terror as this shriek of the dying Ba- 
taille. And she heard it still, her ears were buzzing 
with it, all her flesh shivered with agony. 

" Take me away ! take me away ! " 

Etienne seized her and carried her away. But it 
was a long time before they could reach the chim- 
ney, which they ascended. He had to help her, for 
she had no longer strength enough to cling to the 
timber. Three times he feared that she was slipping 
from him, that she was falling into the deep sea whose 
tide was roaring behind them. Nevertheless they could 
breath for a few moments when they found the first 
road still free. The water reappeared, they must hoist 
themselves up again. And for hours together, this 
ascent continued, the stream chasing them form level 



410 GERMINAL. 

to level, forcing them always upward. At the sixth a 
respite inspired them, with hope, it seemed to them that 
the water remained stationery. 

But a stronger rise took place, they had to clamber 
up to the seventh, then to the eighth. But one re- 
mained, and when they had reached it they watched 
anxiously each centimetre of the water's rise. If it did 
not stop then they must die like the old horse, crushed 
to the roof, their throats filled by the flood. 

Crashing reverberations were heard every moment. 
The whole mine was shaken. At the end of the gal- 
leries, the air, driven back, was collected, compressed, 
resulting in formidable explosions amid the shivered 
rocks and falling earth. It was the terrifying confusion 
of internal convulsions, a small sample of the old battle 
when the deluges visited the earth, beating down the 
mountains under the plains. 

And Catherine, shaken, bewildered by this continual 
sinking, wringing her hands^ stammered unceasingly 
the same words: 

"I don't want to die. ... I don't want to die." 

To reassure her, Etienne swore that the water rose no 
higher. Their flight had now lasted fully six hours; 
they would soon come to their assistance. And he said 
six hours without knowing, for the exact lapse of time 
had escaped them. In realty a whole day had passed 
already in their ascent across the Guillaume vein. Wet, 
tottering, they rested themselves. She undressed with- 
out shame so as to spread out her garments, then she 
put on again the pants and blouse, which dried com- 
pletely on her. As her feet were bare, he forced her 
to put on his sabots. They could wait now, they had 
lowered the wick of the lamp, retaining but a feeble 
light. But pains in the stomach racked them; they 
perceived that they would die of hunger. Thus far 
they had been unconscious of existence. At the mo- 
ment of the catastrophe they had not yet breakfasted, 
and they had just found their slices of bread and butter 
swollen with water — changed into soup at the bottom 
of their pockets. She had to be angry to make him 
eat his share, and as soon as she had finished she fell 
asleep from weariness, on the cold ground. He, unable 
to close his eyelids, kep*'. watch over her, his forehead 



GERMINAL. 411 

between his hands, his eyes fixed. How many hours 
passed thus? He could not tell. What he did know 
was that before him, through the hole of the chimney, 
he saw the black wave reappearing, and moving the 
beast whose back swelled up unceasingly to reach them. 
At first there was but a thin line, a supple serpent 
stretching itself out; then this was enlarged with a 
spine, leaping up alive, rampant; and soon they were 
reached, the feet of the sleeping girl in the water. 
Filled with anxiety, he yet hesitated to awaken her. 
Was it not cruel to take her from this repose, this bliss- 
ful annihilation which perhaps was rocking her in a 
dream of pure air and sunlight. Besides, to what part 
could they flee? He looked about, and remembered 
that the inclined plane, established in this part of the 
vein, was connected according to the plan with the 
upper shaft room. That was an outlet; he allowed her 
to sleep on, as long as it was possible, watching the 
gaining flood, waiting for it to drive them away. At 
length he gently lifted her up, and she shivered slightly. 

*'Ah! my God! it is true! . . . This begins 
again. '■* 

She rose, crying to again meet approaching death. 

"No, calm yourself," murmured he. "We can go 
on further, I swear it." 

To reach the inclined plane, they were compelled to 
walk stooping ; again the water reached to their 
shoulders. The ascent again commenced, more dan- 
gerous, by that way entirely wooded for over fifty 
metres. First he tightened the cable; they fastened 
down at the bottom one of the cars, for if the other 
had descended during their ascent it would have crushed 
them. Finally they took the risks, not daring to make 
use of that cable which they feared and clinging with 
their nails. He climbing behind her, protected her 
head when she slipped, with bleeding hands. Suddenly 
they struck against some beams which obstructed the 
plane. Some earth had also fallen, a cave-in prevented 
them from going higher. By chance, a door opened 
there and they passed into a road. 

Before them the rays of a lamp amazed them. A 
man angrily cried: 

"Some more fools as crazy as me! . . . Great 



412 GERMINAL. 

heavens! get out of here. I don't want to see you 
others die." 

They recognized Cheval. He had been blocked there 
by a cave-in which had filled up the inclined plane; and 
the two comrades who had set out with him had been 
left on the road with their heads split open by the fall 
of rocks. He, with a wounded shoulder, had crawled 
along beside them to take their lamps and steal their 
sandwiches. As he jumped back, a last shock behind 
him had filled up the gallery. 

He immediately thought that he would be compelled 
to share his provisions with there comrades who had ar- 
rived. No, he would kill them first. Then as he re- 
cognized them his rage passed away and he laughed a 
wicked laugh. 

" Ah! it's you Catherine! so you have come back here 
to find your man. That was right." 

He affected not to notice Etienne, who agitated by 
this meeting, made a gesture as if to protect the girl 
who drew closer to his side. However he must accept 
the situation, he simply said to the comrade, as though 
they had left each other good friends, an hour before. 

** Have you seen the bottom? We cannot get through 
the drifts. 

Cheval still laughed. 

" Indeed! so the drifts have fallen too, then we are 
between two walls, a regular mouse-trap. . . . But 
if you're a good swimmer you might go back by the 
plane." 

In reality the water was ascending, they heard it 
washing in the tunnel between the timbering. The 
retreat was already cut off. And they were right, it 
was a mouse trap at the end of a gallery, which the 
sinking had obstructed before and behind. By chance 
all three were walled in together. 

*'Then you are going to remain?" said Cheval, jeer- 
ingly. " Go on, you'd be doing better to leave me in 
peace, for I don't want to sjoeak to you. . . . But 
there is room here for two men. We will soon see 
which will die the first, at least we will see who will 
suffer the most." 

The young man said: 

" If we knock, perhaps they will hear." 



^ GEEMINAL. 413 . 

" I am tired of knocking; . . . but take that 
stone, try and see if you will be more successful/^ 

Etienne gathered up the pieces of stone which the 
other had already broken up, and struck against the 
vein, the call of the miners, the prolonged roll with 
which the workmen in peril signaled their presence. 
Then he pressed his ear down to listen. After twenty 
failures he grew desjDerate; not one sound responded. 

During this time Cheval coolly arranged to set up 
housekeej)iDg. At first he ranged his three lamps 
against the wall; one was burning, the two others would 
serve them later on. Then he placed upon a piece of 
wood the two sandwiches which he still had; it was the 
buffet; he could get along with that for two days if he 
was reasonable. He turned around and said: 

" You know, Catherine, half of this is for you when 
you are too hungry.-" 

The young girl did not reply. It increased her un- 
happiness still more to find herself with these two men. 

The frightful life commenced, neither Cheval nor 
Etienne opening his mouth, seated upon the ground 
some steps apart. Upon the suggestion of the former 
the latter extinguished his lamp, a useless luxury; then 
they again fell into silence. Catharine was seated near 
the young man, uneasy at the glances which her old 
lover threw upon her. The hours slowly passed by; 
they heard the little murmur of the still rising water; 
while from time to time profound shocks and distant 
falls announced the last caving-in of the mine. When 
the lamp was empty and it was necessary to open 
another to light it, the fear of fire damp excited them 
for an instant; but they would rather have been blown 
up at once than remain in the darkness; but nothing 
exploded, there was no fire damp. They again stretched 
themselves out and the hours dragged on. 

A sound startled Etienne and Catherine who raised 
their heads. Cheval had decided to eat; he cut a sand- 
wich in half and he chewed it for a long time so as not 
to be in a hurry about swallowing it all. They, whom 
hunger was torturing, watched him eagerly. 

" Then you don't want it?" said he to the girl, with 
his provoking air. " You're wrong." 

She lowered her head, fearing to yield, her stomach 



414 GEKMINAL. 

torn with such cramps that tears fell from her eye- 
lashes. But he knew what she was after; she wanted 
him to take her back again now that he saw her near an- 
other. And she did not want to again make these men 
attack each other in that narrow cave in which they were 
suffering so now. " My God! couldn't they at least die 
friendly!" 

Etienne would have died helplessly, rather than beg 
Cheval for a mouthful of bread. Silence again fell. 
The monotonous moments which passed, one by one, 
without hoiae, seemed prolonged into centuries. It had 
only been one day since they were all there shut up. 
The two lamps had gone out, and they had lit the third. 
Cheval cut into another sandwich, and he growled: 

"Come on now, fool!" 

Catherine shivered. To leave her free to decide, 
Etienne turned around. Then, when she did not stir, 
he said to her, in a low voice: 

*'Go, my child." 

The tears which had been choking her then fell fast. 
She wept on, not even finding the strength to raise her- 
self, no longer knowing if she was hungry, suffering 
from a grief which had invaded her entire body. He 
walked back and forth, vainly beating the call of the 
miners, enraged at that life which he was forced to live 
there, close to a rival whom he hated. Not even space 
to die apart. As soon as he took ten steps he was 
forced to return and knock against that man. 

Another day was ending, and Cheval approached 
Catherine to offer her the half of the sandwich. She 
ate the mouthfuls slowly, and he made her pay for each 
with a caress. 

Etienne, shivering, had placed his face against the 
wood so as not to see. But suddenly he returned with 
a bound, furious. 

" Great God! will you leave her alone?" 

" Is this any of your business?" said Cheval. *^ She 
is my woman, isn^t she? " 

And par bravade he rubbed her mouth with his red 
mustache, continuing: 

" Leave us alone, will you?" 

But Etienne, his teeth pressed together, cried: 

*' If you don't let her be I'll strangle you." 



GERMIKAL. 415 

The other quickly arose, for he comprehended by 
the sound of the voice that the comrade was going to 
end it. Death there seemed too slow, it was necessary 
that at once one of the two yielded his place. It was 
the old battle commenced again under the ground 
where they would soon sleep side by side; and they had 
so little space they could not brandish their fists with- 
brtiising them. 

" This time I'll finish you," growled Cheval. 

Etienne at this became crazy. It was as if a stream 
of blood came up from his veins and flooded his eyes 
with a red flame. He was filled with an irresistible 
wish to kill, a physical wish, the excitation of a mu- 
cus which produces a violent fit of coughing. It was 
beyond the power of his will and under the control- 
ling influence of the hereditary wrong. He had seen a 
piece of slate sticking from the wall and he seized it 
and broke it oflp, a very large and very heavy piece. 
Then with both hands he brought it down on ChevaFs 
head. 

The latter had not the time to jump back. He fell, 
his face crushed and his skull broken. His brains 
splashed the ceiling of the gallery and a purplish jet 
ran from the wound. There was soon a.pool in which 
the smoky rays of the lamp were reflected. Darkness 
prevailed in the vault, the body seemed, upon the 
ground, a black spot in a heap of rubbish. 

Stooping over, with his eyes enlarged, Etienne looked 
at him. It was over; he had killed him. Confusedly 
all his strifes returned to him, that useless combat 
against the poison which slept in his muscles, the alco- 
hol slowly accumulated by his race. However, he was 
only drunk from hunger, the old-time drunkenness of 
his parents had ended. His hair stood on end at the 
horror of that murder; but in spite of the revolt of his 
education, a cheerful sensation made his heart beat, the 
animal joy of an appetite at last satisfied. His pride at 
length arose, the pride of the stronger. Suddenly the 
little soldier appeared to him, his throat stuck with a 
knife, killed by a child. He also had killed. 

But Catherine screamed: 

''My God! He is dead!" 

*'Do you regret him?" asked Etienne fiercely. 



416 GERMINAL. 

She choked and stammered. Then staggering, she 
threw herself in his arms. 

" Ah! kill me too! Ah! we will both die! " 

With an embrace she caught him by the shoulders, 
and he also clasped her, and then they hoped that they 
would die. But death was in no haste, they loosened 
their arms. Then, while she covered her eyes, he 
dragged the miserable wretch and threw him down the 
incline, in order to get him out of the narrow place in 
which they still were compelled to live. Life would be 
impossible with that corpse under their feet. Both 
were appalled when they heard him plunge in the 
midst of the seething scum. The water had then 
already filled that hole, and they perceived that it was 
extending into the gallery. 

Then came a new waiting. They lit the last lamp. 
it was wasted in clearing the water, the regular stub- 
born rise of which did not pause. First the water came 
to their ankles, then to their knees, the road ascended, 
they took refuge at the top, which gave them a respite 
of some hours. But the flood overtook them, coming up 
as far as their waists. Motionless, their backs pressed 
against the rock, they watched it grow higher and 
higher. When it reached their mouths it would be all 
over. The lamp which they had hung up, lighted the 
coal in little yellow waves; it grew dimmer; they could 
no longer distinguish more than a half circle, con- 
stantly diminishing as if eaten by the shadow which 
seemed to enlarge with the flood; and suddenly the 
shades fell; the lamp was extinguished after sputtering 
its last drop of oil. It was complete and absolute dark- 
ness, such darkness as above ground they slept in with- 
out ever opening their eyes to the light. 

" Great God!" cried Etienne. 

Catherine, as if she had felt the shadows seize her, 
sheltered herself against him. She repeated the 
miners saying in a low voice. 

" Death blew out the lamp." Then at that warning, 
a flow of life revived them. He violently set to work 
to break the schist with the wire of the lamp, while she 
aidded him with her nails. They made in that manner 
a sort of raised ledge, and when they had both raised 
themselves up upon it, they sat down, swinging their 



GEKMINAL. 417 

limbs, their backs bent, for the arch forced them to 
lower their heads. Now the water chilled only their 
heels; but they still felt the cold which pierced their 
limbs, their knees in fixed position, without relaxation. 
The uneven ledge became so soaked with a sticky damp- 
ness that they were compelled to hold on as long as 
possible, to keep them from sliding off. It was the 
end, which they now waited for, reduced to that niche, 
where they dared not risk a movement, weakened, fam- 
ished, no longer having either bread or light; and they 
suffered especially from the darkness, which prevented 
them from seeing death approach. A great silence 
reigned in the mine, filled with water no longer forced. 
They now had below them only the feeling of that 
water, spreading out at the bottom of the galleries its 
silent flow." 

The hours followed each other, all equally black, 
without their knowing the exact time becoming more 
and more mixed in their calculations. Their tortures 
which should have lengthened the minutes, carried them 
on rapidly. They thought they had been shut up two 
days and a night, when in reality the third day was 
already finished. All hope of assistance had left them, 
no one knew them to be there, no one sought to come 
there and hunger would finish them if they were not 
drowned. A last time; they thought to beat the call; 
but the stone had remained below. At any rate, who 
would hear them? 

Catherine, resigned, had leaned her weary head against 
the vein when she heard a sound. 

"Listen!" stammered she. 

At first Etienne believed she was speaking of the little 
noise of the water which was always rising. He lied, 
wishing to calm her. 

"It's me that you hear. I'm moving my legs," 

''No, no, not that. It's there below; listen." 

And she stuck her ear close to the coal. He under- 
stood and did as she did. A waiting of some seconds 
oppressed them. Then, very far off, very weak, they 
heard three blows wide apart. But they still doubted 
their ear, it was perhaps the cracking of the coal. And 
they did not know what to beat a reply with. 

Etienne had an idea. 
27 



418 GEKMINAL. 

" You have on your sabots. Put out your feet and 
beat with your heels." She beat the call of the miners^ 
and they listened, again distinguishing the three blows 
in the distance. Twenty times they renewed it, and 
twenty times the blow replied^ They wept; they em- 
braced each other, at the risk of losing their balance. 
Their comrades were at least there; they had arrived. 
It was an outburst of Joy and love which carried away 
the torments of waiting, the agony of the calls which 
for so long a time were useless, as if their deliverers had 
only to split the rock with their fingers to rescue them. 

" Well! " cried she, gaily; '* it was luck that 1 laid my 
head back." 

"Oh, youVe ears!" said he. "As for me, I heard 
nothing." 

From this moment they took turns, one of them 
always listening, ready to answer at the slightest signal 
They soon heard the blows of the pick; the work was 
coming nearer; they were opening a gallery. Not a 
sound escaped them. But their joy fell. In spite of 
their laughing to deceive each other, despair gradually 
took possession of them again. At first they were pro- 
fuse in suggestions. They were evidently coming from 
Requillart, the gallery doubtless descended into the 
vein. Perhaps several of them would be opened, for 
there were three men at the work. Then they spoke 
less, and at last they were silent, when they began to 
calculate what an enormous mass separated them from 
their comrades. Mute, they continued their reflections. 
They counted the days and days a workman would take 
to pierce through such a block. They could never 
reach them in time; they would be dead twenty times 
over. And gloomy, not daring to exchange another 
word in this increased anguish, they only replied to the 
calls by a movement of their sabots, hopeless, and only 
mechanically telling the others that they still lived. 

One day, two days passed. For six days they had 
been at the bottom. The water, stopped at their knees, 
neither rose nor fell; and their legs seemed to be para- 
lyzed in this icy bath. For an hour they could easily 
draw them out; but the position then became so incon- 
venient, that they were taken with frightful cramps 



GERMIKAL. 419 

and obliged to put their heels down again. Every ten 
minutes, with a sprain of the loins, they remounted the 
slippery rock. The fractures of coal pierced their 
backs, and they had, at the nape of the neck, constant 
and intense pain from keeping always bent to avoid 
knocking their heads against the roof. 

And the suffocation increased. The air, driven 
back by the water, was compressed into the kind of bell 
in which they found themselves enclosed. Their voices, 
muffled, appeared to come from afar. Buzzing in the 
ear commenced, they heard the sharp ringing of the 
tocsin, the galoping of a herd under an unceasing 
shower of hail. 

At first, Catherine suffered terribly from hunger. She 
carried her poor shriveled hands to her throat, her 
breathing was hollow and deep, with a continual heart- 
rending moan, as if her stomach was being torn out 
with pincers. Etienne, suffering from the same torture, 
was tottering feverishly in the darkness, when, near 
him his fingers came in contact with a piece of wood, 
half rotten, which his nails crumbled. He gave a hand- 
ful to the girl, who swallowed it greedily. During the 
two days they lived on this worm-eaten wood, they de- 
voured the whole of it, in despair, when they had 
finished it, skinning themselves in trying to make 
incisions in other pieces still solid, and whose fibres 
resisted. Their torture increased, they were enraged 
that they could not masticate the linen ot their gar- 
ments. A leather belt round his waist relieved them a 
little. He bit off little pieces, she chewed them slowly, 
and finally swallowed them. This occupied their Jaws, 
and made them believe they were eating. Then, when 
the belt was finished, they returned to the linen, suck- 
ing it for hours together. 

But soon these violent crises passed off. Hunger be- 
came only a deep, dumb pain, the swooning away as 
it were, slow and steady, of their faculties, mental and 
physical. 

Without a doubt they would have succumbed if they 
had not had water, as much of it as they wanted. They 
simply stooped and drank it from the hollow of the 
hand, and that twenty times over, burning as they were 



420 GERMINAL. 

with such a thirst that ail this water seemed unable to 
quench. 

On the seventh day, Catherine was stooping to drink 
when she struck her hand against some floating body 
before her. 

"Look! what's that.'' 

Etienne groped about in the darkness. 

'*I don't understand. One would think it was the 
covering of a ventilating door." 

She drank, but as she was reaching for a second 
mouthful the body again struck her hand. She uttered 
a terrible cry. 

"It's him; my God!" 

"Who?" 

*' Him; you know! I felt his mustache." 

It was the corpse of Cheval, which had ascended the 
inclined plane, washed up to them by the water. 
Etienne again stretched out his arm and also felt the 
mustache, the broken nose, and a feeling of repugnance 
and fear passed over him, filling him with a horrible 
nausea. Catherine spat out the water which was in her 
mouth. She believed she was drinking blood; that all 
that deep water before her was now the blood of that 
man. 

"Hold on," said Etienne, **" I am going to send him 
back again." 

He gave the corpse a kick and it went off. But they 
soon felt it again beating ugainst their limbs. 

"Great heavens! send it away." 

But the third time Eitenne was obliged to give it up, 
the stream always brought it back. Cheval did not wish 
to leave them, he wished to be with them, against them. 
It was a frightful companion, who finished by poisoning 
the air. During the whole day they did not drink, 
struggling, wishing to die; but the next day their suf- 
ferings decided them. They turned away the body to 
get each mouthful they drank, but they could scarcely 
turn their heads before he was once more between them, 
obstinate in his jealousy. Until the end he would be 
there, even though dead he kept them apart. 

Another and still another day passed by. Etienne at 
each swell of the water received a slight knock from the 
man he had killed, the simnle jostling of a neighbor who 



GEKMIÎfAL. 431 

makes known his presence. He trembled continually, 
seeing always before him that crushed face with its red 
mustache. Then he no longer remembered that if he 
had not killed him the other would have been the mur- 
derer Catherine now shook with tears after which she 
would sink into unconsciousness. She ended by falling 
into a state of somnolence. He would awaken her, she 
would stammer a few words, and then fall off to sleep 
again without ever once raising her eyelids; and tor fear 
she would slip off and be drowned he passed an arm 
around her. He was now compelled to reply to the 
comrades. The blows of the picks were approaching 
and he could hear them behind his back. But his 
strength was so diminished that he had lost all courage 
to knock. They knew they were there, why fatigue 
himself more? It no longer interested him to know 
whether they were able to come on. In the terror of his 
watch, for some hours he had forgotten what he was 
watching for. 

They were comforted a little at least. The water 
lowered and the corpse of Cheval floated off. For nine 
days they had been working to deliver them, and they 
heard for the first time the steps in the gallery, when a 
shock threw them on the ground. They threw them- 
selves into each other's arms, not comprehending and 
believing that a catastrophe was approaching. Nothing 
moved now, the sounds of the picks had ceased. 

In the corner where they had seated themselves, side 
by side, Catherine laughed slightly. 

" It must be good outside. Come, let's go out of 
here." 

Etienne at first struggled against insanity. But the 
contagion shook his more evenly balanced head, he lost 
all sense of reality. Their senses were leaving them, 
especially Catherine, who feverish, was tormented with 
a desire for speech and gestures. The sounds in her 
ears had become those of running water and the sing- 
ing of birds ; and she smelt a strong perfume of crushed 
herbs, and she saw clearly great yellow spots flying 
before her eyes so large that she believed herself outside, 
near the canal, in the wheat fields under a beautiful day 
of sunshine. 



423 GERMINAL. 

''It's warm now. . . . Take me^ let's remain 
together, oh ! always, always. 

He pressed her to him and she continued with the 
bantering tone of a happy girl : 

'* You've been foolish to wait so long, I always 
wanted you but you wouldn't understand." 

Her gaiety had infected him also, and he said in his 
turn : 

" Yes, but you hit me once, on both cheeks.'* 

" It was because I loved," she murmured. "I knew 
that one day or other we would be together/ 

A shiver passed over him; he wished to hasten that 
dream, then he murmured the thought which he had 
formerly had. 

''Nothing is ever finished; a little happiness, and 
then it will again commence." 

" But you will keep me now?" 

And half fainting she slipped. She was so weak that 
her voice died away. Frightened, he clasped her to his 
heart. 

"Are you suffering?" 

She straightened up, astonished. 

" No, not at all. . . . Why?" 

But that question awakened him from his dream. 

She peered into the shadows, she caught his hands 
and cried in a new burst of tears: 

" My God! my God! but it is dark! " 

It was no longer the wheat fields, nor the odor of 
herbs, nor the song of the larks, nor the great yellow 
sun; it was the sunken and inundated mine, the disa- 
greeable night and the mournful drooping of that cave 
in which they had existed all these days. The perver- 
sion of her senses aggravated the horror no-vy. She was 
re-taken with the superstition of her childhood. She 
saw the Black Man, the old miner who returned to the 
mine to wring the necks of bad girls. 

" Listen! did you hear?" 

"No, nothing; I heard nothing." 

"If it's the Black Man, you know. ... Oh! 
there he is! . . . The earth has given all her blood 
to avenge the cutting of her arteries; and he is there, 
look! he's blacker than the night! . . . Oh! I'm 
afraid! Oh! I'm afraid!" 



GERMIN-AL. 433 

She became silent, shivering. Then in a very low 
voice, she continued: 

" No, it's the other." 

"What other?" 

"The one who is with us." . . . The image of 
Cheval haunted her, and she spoke of him confusedly, 
she related their dog-like existence, the only day when 
he had been good to her, at Jean-Bart; the other days 
of harsh words and kicks, when he almost killed her 
with caresses immediately after a blow. 

" I say that he's coming, he will still keep us from 
being together! . . . His jealousy is coming back. 
Oh! take me, keep me, keep me yourself." 

She threw herself upon him, she found his mouth 
and firmly placed hers upon it. The shadows cleared 
away, she again laughed a loving laugh. He shudder- 
ingly clasped her to him. 

Hours passed. Etienne sat always in the same cor- 
ner, upon the ground, with Catherine motionless upon 
his knee. For a long time he believed she slept; then 
he touched her, she was very cold^ she was dead. How 
ever he did not move for fear of awakening her Plans 
for the future returned at intervals, but they were so 
vague that they seemed to pass before his face like a 
sleeping breath. He grew weaker, there only remained 
to him the strength for a feeble gesture, a slow move- 
ment of the hand to assure himself that she was still 
there like a sleeping child, in her very stiffness. Every- 
thing was annihilated, even the lapse of time. Some- 
thing was knocking at his side, blows of which the 
violence approached closer to him; but he was too weak 
to go and respond, filled with a great weariness; and at 
present he knew nothing, he only dreamed that she was 
walking before him and that he heard the light knock- 
ing of her sabots. Two days passed on, she had not 
moved, he touched her with his mechanical gesture, re- 
assured to feel her so quiet. 

Etienne experienced a shock. Voices were heard, 
and rocks rolled to his feet. When he perceived a lamp, 
he wept, his blinking yes, followed the rays, never leav- 
ing it, in an ecstacy before that reddening light which 
scarcely pierced the shadows. But some comrades car- 
ried him away, he let them put between his closed teeth 



424 GEKMINAL. 

some spoonfuls of bouillon. It was only in the gallery 
of Eequillart that he recognized some one, the engineer 
Megrel standing before him; and these two men who 
had scorned each other, the rebellions workman, the 
sceptical chief threw themselves on each others neck 
sobbing in the deep throbbing of all the humanity which 
was in them. It was a sad scene, the misery of genera- 
tions, the excess of grief which made life give way. 

At the top, la Maheu threw herself beside Catherine's 
body, emiting one scream after the other, in great cries, 
long and incessant. 

Several corpses had already been brought up and 
placed on the ground. Cheval whom they thought had 
been crushed under a cave-in, a boy and two miners in 
like manner crushed, their brains gone from their heads, 
their stomachs filled with water. Some women in the 
crowd losing their reason, tore their clothing and 
scratched their faces. When they at length brought 
him out, after becoming habituated to the lamps and 
having been fed a little, Etienne appeared greatly 
emaciated, and his hair was white; they were struck 
dumb, and shuddered in the presence of that old m.an. 
La Maheu stopped screaming to stupidly look at him 
with great staring eyes. 



CHAPTEK XL. 



It was four o*clôck in the morning. The cool April 
night grew warmer with the approach of day. The 
stars were paling in the clear sky as the light of the 
early dawn purpled the east. And the black country, 
still drowsy, but faintly stirred with the vague sounds 
which precede the reveille. 

Etienne, with long strides, was following the Vandame 
road. He had just passed six weeks at Montson in a 
hospital bed. Still pale and very thin, he had felt 
himself strong enough to leave, and he left. The com- 
pany, still uneasy about their mines, and going on with 
their dismissals in their policy of prudence, had given 
him notice that they could not keep him; they also 



GEKillXAL. 425 

offered him a gratuity of a hundred francs with the 
paternal advice to give up work in the mines as being 
henceforth too hard for him. He had refused the 
hundred francs. A letter in reply from Pluchart, con- 
taining money for the journey, had already arrived, 
calling him to Paris. It was the realization of his 
dream. On leaving the hospital the evening before he 
had slept at Bon- Joy eux at the widow Desiree's. He 
had risen very early, with but one wish left, to say 
adieu to his old comrades before taking the eight o'clock 
train for Marchiennes. 

For an instant, Etienne stopped on the road now 
bathed in the rosy dawn. It was good to breathe this 
air so pure with the early spring. It was a glorious 
morning. Slowly the day grew, the life of the earth 
rose with the sun. He resumed his walk, leaning heav- 
ily on his dog-wood stick, looking at the plain in the 
distance emerging from the vapors of the night. He 
had seen no one recently ; la Maheude had come once 
to the hospital, but had doubtless been unable to return. 
But he knew that all the alley of the Deux-Cent- 
Quarante went down to Jean-Bart now, and that she 
herself must have resumed work there. Gradually the 
deserted roads were filling, coalmen were continually 
passing near Etienne, with pale, silent faces. It was 
said that the company was taking advantage of their 
victory. After a strike of tvro months and a half, beaten 
by hunger, when they had returned to the mines, they 
had been obliged to accept the timbering tariff, a dis- 
guised reduction of wages, odious to them now from 
being stained with the blood of their comrades. An 
hour of work was stolen from them, they made tliem 
give the lie to their oath of resistance, and this enforced 
perjury stuck in their throats like gall. Work was re- 
sumed everywhere, at Miron, at Madeleine, at Creve- 
cœur, at Victoire. Everywhere, through the morning 
mist along the roads veiled in darkness, the army 
tramped, files of meu with their noses to the ground like 
cattle going to the slaughter house. They shivered 
under their thin linen garments, they crossed their 
arms, wiggled their loins, swelled out their backs, 
deformed by the sandwich lodged between the shirt and 
the blouse. And in this return en masse, in these 



426 GEKMINAL. 

mute dark spectres, without a laugh, without a side 
look, one felt that the teeth were shut in anger, the 
heart swelling with hatred, the only submission being 
that of dire necessity. 

Their numbers kept increasing as Etienne drew 
nearer the mine. Nearly all walked alone; those who 
came in groups followed each other in file, tired and 
weary, weary of themselves and of each other. He per- 
ceived one very old man whose eyes sparkled like coals 
under a livid brow. Further on a young man whispered 
the restrained whisper of the tempest. Many had their 
sabots in their hands, and the soft noise of their large 
woollen stockings was hardly heard. It was an endless 
stream, an overflow, a forced march of a beaten army, 
with drooping heads, dumbly possessed with a longing to 
resume the fight and avenge themselves. 

When Etienne arrived at last, Jean-Bart was emerging 
from the shadows, the lamps hanging from the tressels 
burned in the rising dawn. Above the dark buildings 
an escapement raised itself like a white aigrette deli- 
cately tinted with carmine. He took the screening- 
shed staircase to reach the receiver's room. 

The descent commenced; workmen came up from the 
waiting-room. For a moment, he remained motionless 
in this hubbub and bustle. The rolling of the cars 
shook the flagging; the drums turned, unwound the 
cables, in the midst of the clatter of the speaking- 
trumpet, the ringing of bells, the blows of the club on 
the signal block; and he found the monster again swal- 
lowing his ration of human flesh, the cages emerging, 
replunging, gulping down loads of men without a stop, 
with the easy swallow of a voracious giant. Since his 
accident, he had a nervous horror of the mine. Those 
cages, plunging down, down, seemed to be taking his 
life with them. He felt the dizziness of a fall. He had 
to turn his head; the shaft made him sick. But in the 
vast room, still dark, where the exhausted lamps were 
dying out, he perceived no friendly face. The miners 
who were waiting there, with bare feet, lamp in hand, 
looked at him with their large, troubled eyes, then bent 
their brows, drawing back in shame. They, no doubt, 
knew him, and no longer felt any bitterness toward 
him. They seemed, on the contrary, to fear him, red-. 



GERMIXAL. 427 

dening at the thought that he would reproach them as 
cowards. This attitude made his heart swell. He 
excused these miserable creatures for having stoned 
him. He began again to dream of changing them into 
heroes, of directing the people, that force of nature 
which was preying upon itself. 

A cage let out some men; the squad disappeared, and 
when the others arrived he perceived one of the lieuten- 
ants of the strike, a brave man, who had sworn to die. 

"You too!"" murmured he, heart-broken. 

The other paled, his lip trembled; then, with a 
gesture of excuse: 

''What else? I've got a wife." 

Now, in the new group which were filling the waitiug- 
room, they recognized each other: 

''You, too! and you and you!'' 

And all, shivering, stammered, with a stifled voice: 

"I've got a mother. . . . I've got children. . . . 
They must have bread." 

The cage did not reappear; they were waiting for it, 
and suffering so much from their defeat that they 
avoided glancing at each other and obstinately looked 
dow the shaft. 

"And la Maheu?" asked Etienne. 

They did not reply. One made a sign that she 
intended to come. Others raised their arms, trembling 
with pity ; Ah ! the poor woman ! What misery ! 
The silence continued, and when the comrades held out 
their hands to say adieu they were strongly affected. 
All felt the same silent rage at having yielded, the 
feverish hope of retaliation. The cage was there, they 
embarked, and were again swallowed up. 

Pierron had appeared with an open lamp; an overseer 
fixed it in his cap. For eight days he had been chief 
of the shaft-room, and the workmen turned aside, for 
these honors rendered them furious. The sight of 
Etienne embarrassed him; he approached, however, and 
became reassured when the young man announced to 
him his departure. He talked with him, speaking of 
his wife who now kept the saloon. Progrès, thanks to 
the assistance of all those gentlemen who had been so 
good to them. But, he interrupted himself, he was fu- 
rious against old Mouque, whom he accused of not having

sent up the rubbish from the stable at the regular hour. 
The old man listened and shrugged his shoulders. Then 
before descending, angry at that reprimand, he also 
gave his hand to Etienne, with the same long clasp as 
the others, hot with rage, feeling already the future re- 
bellious. And that old hand, which trembled in press- 
ing his own, that old man who pardoned him for his 
dead children, choked him with such emotion that he 
watched him disappear down the shaft without saying a 
word to him. 

*' La Maheu isn't coming this morning, then?" 
said he to Pierron, after a pause. 

The latter pretended not to have understood, for he 
did not wish to talk with him. Then,, when he went 
away under the pretense of giving an order, he finally 
said: 

''What? la Maheu! . . . There she is. '* 

La Maheu, in blouse and pants, her head in a 
béguin, had arrived from the waiting-room lamp in 
hand. It was a charitable excejation that the company 
took pity upon her miserable condition, and had 
allowed her to descend at the age of forty years, and as 
it would have been difficult for her to roll again they 
set her to working a little ventilator which they had set 
up in the north gallery, in that hell-like region under la 
Tartaret where the air was bad. For ten hours, with 
bent back, she turned her wheel at the end of a hot 
opening, her skin j)arched by a high degree of heat, and 
for this toil she earned thirty sous. 

When Etienne perceived her, pitiful, in her man's 
clothing he could not find words to tell her that he was 
going away, and that he wished to say adieu. 

She looked at him without seeming to hear. At 
length she said in a friendly tone: 

" Well! it surprises you to see me, don't it? Yes, it's 
true I threatened to strangle the first of my family who 
went down again, and here I'm doing it myself. I 
ought to strangle myself, oughtn't I? Well, I would 
do it if I hadn't the old man and little one's at home. 

And she continued in a low and weary voice. She 
did not excuse herself, she simply related facts, that 
they were starving and that she had thus decided, so 
that they would not drive them from the alley. 



GERMINAL. 429 

"How is the old man?" asked. Etienne. 

*'He is always very quiet and good now. But his 
head is completely gone. . . . They have not even 
tried him for that affair, you know! They wanted to 
put him in the asylum, but I didn^t want it, I was afraid 
they'd end him there. His act has done us a great 
deal of harm, all the same, for he has never got his 
pension; one of those gentlemen, told me it would be 
wrong for them to give him one now. 

"Does Jeanlin work?" 

"Yes, the gentlemen have found him outside work. 
He earns twenty sous. . . . Oh! I don't complain, 
the chief have shown themselves to be very good. The 
boys twenty sous and my thirty, that makes fifty sous. 
. . . There are six of us to be fed. Estelle eats now 
and the worst is that we'll have to wait four or five years 
before Lenore and Henri are old enough to go down in 
the mine." 

Etienne could not restrain a sad gesture. 

"They, too." 

The wan cheeks of la Mahue reddened while a flame 
seemed to light up her eyes. But she shrugged her 
shoulders as if under the burden of destiny. 

"Certainly, they're after the others. . . . They 
haven't all lost their lives yet, it's their turn now." 

She became silent, some wheelers, sending their cars 
along pushed them out of the way. Through the great 
dusty windows the daylight entered, paling the lanterns, 
clearing up the room with a sad light, and the shaking 
of the machinery continued while the cables wound and 
unwound, and the cages continued to swallow up the 
men. 

" Come on, come on, hurry up!" cried Pierron. " Get 
in, we'll never be through to-day." 

La Maheu, whom he was looking at, did not stir. 
She had already allowed three cages to pass; she re- 
sumed as if awakening from a dream and remembering 
the first words of Etienne: 

" Then you are leaving?" 

" Yes, this morning." 

'* You are right; it's better to be somewhere else if 
you can. I'm glad to have seen you, because you'll at 
least know that I have nothing in my heart against you. 



430 GEKMINAL. 

At one time I could have killed you after all those 
deaths. But one always reflects don't they? And they 
find out in the end that it's the fault of no one. . . . 
No, no; it's not your fault; it's the fault of every one." 

Now she spoke tranquilly of the death of her poor 
man, and of Zacharie and Catherine, and only when 
she pronounced the name of Alzire the tears filled her 
eyes. The calm of a reasonable woman had returned 
to her; she very wisely judged things. It would not 
bring the owners luck to have killed her people. Surely 
they would be punished one day for all they had done. 
They need not even concern themselves about it, the 
battle would fight itself alone, the soldiers would fire 
upon the owners just as they had fired upon the work- 
men. And, in her calm resignation, in that hereditary 
discipline, which had again become a part of her, one 
thought was fixed, the certainty that injustice could not 
last longer, and that if there was no longer one good God 
another would come up to avenge the miserable people. 

She was speaking very low, with defiant looks around 
her. Then, when Pierron approached, she added, in a 
high voice: 

"Well, if you are going, you must go to our house 
for your things. . . . There are two shirts, three 
handkerchiefs and an old pair of pants." 

Etienne, with a gesture, refused these few things 
which had been refused by the second-hand dealei^s. 

"No, I don't want the bother of them, they'll do for 
the children. ... I will fix myself at Paris." 

Two more cages had descended, and Pierron had de- 
cided to call la Maheu. 

"Say now, there, we're waiting for you. Are you 
nearly through talking?" 

But she turned her back. What had he to do with 
her? That descent didn't concern him. The men at 
the shaft hated him enough already. And she became 
obstinate; with her lamp between her fingers she was 
freezing in the currents of air, in spite of the mildness 
of the season. 

Neither Etienne nor the woman could find another 
word to say. They remained face to face, with hearts 
bursting when they would have wished to say some- 
thing. 



GERMINAL. 431 

Finally, to break the silence, she said: 

*'Levaque^s in prison yet, and Philomêne's gone off." 

"How, gone off?" 

"Gone off with a miner from Pas-de- Calais. I was 
afraid she'd leave me the two children, but no, she took 
them with her. . . . Well; she spits blood all the 
time and looks as if she was dying." 

That was all; they spoke no more. A cage was wait- 
ing for her and in a rage they called and threatened to 
fine her. Then she decided to go. She pressed his 
hand. Very pale, he still looked at her, so wretched, 
with her livid face, her discolored hair flying from the 
blue béguin, and her body deformed under the linen 
pants and blouse. And in the last pressure of that 
hand, he again found like his comrades, a long, silent 
wish for the day when their life would commence. He 
comprehended perfectly that she had, in the depth of 
her eyes, a tranquil belief. . . . Soon would come 
the great blow. 

" Will you come on?" cried Pierron. 

Pushed and shoved, la Maheu found herself at the 
bottom of a car with four others. They drew the signal 
cord to sound " a la viande;" the cage was unfastened 
and fell into the darkness; and nothing was heard but 
the rapid flight of the cable. 

Then Etienne left the mme. Below in the screening 
shed, he perceived a being seated upon the ground, his 
limbs stretched out in the midst of a thick bed of coal. 
It was Jeanlin who was employed in sorting the coal. 
He was knocking a block of coal with a hammer to re- 
move the schist; and such a cloud of fine powder arose 
that the young man would never have recognized him, 
had not the child raised his monkey-like face with its 
big ears and greenish eyes. He laughed, then broke 
the block with a last blow, and disappeared in the thick 
dust which arose. 

Outside, Etienne followed the road for a moment lost 
in thought. All sorts of ideas came up in his mind. 
But he felt the open air, the free sky, and he breathed 
freely. The sun appeared in a glorious horizon. It 
was an awakening of cheerfulness in the entire country. 
A flood of gold rolled from the east to the west over the 
immense sea of the plain. The warmth of life was 



432 GÈRMIN-AL. 

gainins:, expanding in an atmosphere of youth, where 
vibrated the sighs of the earth, the song of birds and the 
murmurs of the water. It was good to live. The old 
world was going to live through another spring. 

And penetrated by that hope Etienne slackened his 
walk, his eyes lost at the right and left in the joy of a 
new season. He thought of himself; he felt strong, 
matured by that hard life at the bottom of the mine. 
His education was finished; he was going away armed 
like a soldier who enlisted for the revolution, starting 
out to war against society, which he had seen and which 
he condemned. The joy of going to find Pluchart, to 
be like Pluchart a leader listened to, suggested speeches 
of which he arranged the sentences. H^ meditated on 
enlarging his programme, the higher alliance which he 
had formed above his class threw him into a still greater 
hatred of the aristocracy. These workmen the smell of 
whose misery still possessed him, made him experience 
a wish to raise them to glory, to set them up as the only 
great ones; the only sinless ones, in whom all the noble- 
ness and strength of humanity had been placed. Imagi- 
nation carried him away; he saw himself already at the 
tribune; he would enter with the people on the triumph 
of his ideas, if the people would not destroy him. 

High above him the song of a lark made him look at 
the sky. Little red clouds, the last vapors of the night 
passed on in the limpid blue; and the vague forms of 
Jouvarine and Rasseneur appeared to him. Decidedly 
all was weakened when each one adhered to his own 
ideas. Thus, that famous " International " which 
would have been able to renovate the world, died of 
powerlessness after seeing her formidable army divide 
itself and break into personal quarrels. Was Darwin 
then right? Was the world but a battle field, the 
strong devouring the weak, for the beauty and continu- 
ation of peace? That question troubled him; so much 
so that he decided, from that time forward, to be a man 
content with science. 

But a sudden idea dissipated his doubts and enchanted 
him, that of expounding his theory the first time that 
he spoke. If it was necessary that one class be de- 
stroyed, was it not the people, active, still fresh, who 
should devour the aristocracy worn out with luxury? 



GEKMIXAL. 433 

Xew blood would form a new society. And in the 
expectation of an invasion of barbarians regenerating 
the old decaj^ed nations, he again established his im- 
plicit faith in an approaching revolution, the true one, 
that of the workmen; a conflagration which would fire 
the close of the century with the regal splendor of the 
rising sun, at which he was now looking. 

He continued to walk, dreaming, striking with his 
cane the pebbles on the road; and when he cast his eyes 
around him, he recognized the neighborhood. Exactly 
at the Fourche-aux-Bœufs, he remembered that he had 
there takea the command of the mob on the morning 
of the terrible race across the mines. 

To-day brutal, fatal, ill-paid labor recommenced. Un- 
der the earth over there, at seven hundred metres' dis- 
tance, he seemed to hear the dull, regular and continuous 
blows; it was his comrades whom he had just seen go 
down, his black comrades hammering again in their 
silent anger. Without a doubt they were vanquished; 
it had cost them their money and tlieir dead; but Paris 
vould not forget the firing at Yoreux, the blood of the 
empire wotxld also flow through this incurable wound; 
and if the industrial crisis was drawing to its close, and 
if the factories were re-opened one by one, war was still 
none the less certain, unless real peace should henceforth 
be attainable. The coalmen had counted their num- 
bers, they had tried their strength, and with their cry 
for justice had aroused the workmen of France through- 
out the entire country. Therefore, their defeat reassured 
no one. The peasanty of Moutson, troubled with a 
dumb fear of a morrow of strikes, looked behind them to 
see if their time had not come notwithstanding. At the 
end there was this profound silence. They compre- 
hended that the revolution would rise again, to-morrow, 
perhaps, with a general strike, the agreement of all the 
workmen in saving funds, enabling them to hold out for 
months while still having bread to eat. This time it was 
a shock given to decaying society; they had heard the 
cracking under their feet; they would feel other shocks, 
and still others, until the old rotten edifice, tottering, 
shaking, would be swallowed up like the Yoreux sinking 
into an abyss. 

Etienne took the Joiselle road on the left, and he 
28 



43-1 GE15M1NAL. 

remembered that there he had prevented the mob from 
going to Gaston-Marie. In the distance, in the clear 
sunlight, he saw the towers of several mines, Miron 
upon the right, Madeleine and Crevecœur side by side. 
Work had been resumed everywhere, the blows of the 
picks which he thought he heard at the bottom of the 
earth, now beat from one side of the plain to the other. 
Everywhere, under the fields, the roads, the villages, 
which smiled in the light, was in progress the hidden 
work of underground galley slaves, so crushed beneath 
an enormous mass of rocks that it was only necessary 
to know they were below to distinguish their great sad 
sighs. He thought now that violence had not hastened 
things perhaps. Cut cables, torn up rails, broken lamps 
— what useless work. Was it worth while to run three 
miles in the midst of a band of marauders? 

Vaguely he suspected that right some day might 
prove still more terrible. His reason was maturing. 
He had thrown off his bitterness. Yes, with her good 
sense, la Maheu had well said that this would be the 
right course. To band together quietly, know each 
other, meet together in societies when the laws per- 
mitted it. Then, on the day when they felt their 
strength, when they found themselves numbering 
millions against the few thousand drones, seize the 
power and be the masters. Ah ! what a re-awakening of 
truth and justice! The loathsome crouching God 
would be instantly demolished, the monstrous idol, hid- 
den in the depths of his tabernacle in that far off un- 
known region where the wretched feed him with their 
flesh without having ever seen him. 

But Etienne left the road to Vandarae, and started 
off on the turn-pike. At the right he perceived 
Montson which was fast disappearing. In front he saw 
the shades of the Voreux, the abominable pit where 
three pumps were constantly worked. Then against the 
horizon were the other mines, Victoire, Saint-Thomas, 
and Feutry-Cantel ; while towards the north arose the 
high furnaces and the coke fires, smoking in the clear 
morning air. If he did not wish to miss the eight 
o'clock train he must hurry, for he had still six kilo- 
metres to go. 

And under his feet the heavy blows of the pick con- 



GERMINAL. 435 

tinned. His comrades were all there; lie heard them 
following him at each stride. Under that field of 
beets, was not that la Maheu, working with bent 
back, whose whisper came up so hoarsely, accompanied 
by the rumbling of the ventilator? To the left, to the 
right, further on, he thought he recognized others 
beneath the wheat, the hedges, the young trees. Now, 
in the clear sky, the April sun shone forth in all his 
glory, warming the brooding earth. New life was 
sprouting forth everywhere; the buds were bursting 
into green leaves, and the fields trembled beneath the 
growing herbs. On all sides the grain was swelling, 
stretching out, cracking the soil, pushing on in search of 
heat and light. An overflow of sap ran whisperingly, 
and the bursting of the buds climaxed in a fond kiss. 
Again and again, more and more distinctly, as if they 
had drawn near the soil, the comrades were knocking, 
under the flaming rays of the orb of day, in this youth- 
ful morning; this was the task at which the country 
was laboring. Men were sprouting; a black avenging 
army, still germinating in the furrows, was swelling for" 
the harvests of the next century, and its springing 
growth would soon startle the earth. 

» THE END.
